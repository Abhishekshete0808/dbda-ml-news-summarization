"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday said it has issued show-cause notices to the Indian arm of Chinese mobile phone manufacturer Xiaomi, its chief financial officer and director Sameer B Rao, former managing director Manu Kumar Jain and three foreign banks for alleged violations of the foreign exchange law to the tune of more than Rs 5,551 crore.The Adjudicating Authority (of the Foreign Exchange Management Act) has issued the notices to Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited, the two executives, the CITIbank, the HSBC bank and the Deutsche Bank AG under section 16 of the FEMA, the federal agency said in a statement.A show-cause notice is issued after the completion of a FEMA probe and once it is settled, the accused may have to pay a penalty that could be three times the amount contravened.The notices have been issued to the firm, along with Jain and Rao, the ED said.The Adjudicating Authority has also issued show-cause notices to three banks — Citibank, HSBC Bank and Deutsche Bank AG — for contravention of sections 10(4) and 10(5) of the FEMA and directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as they allowed foreign outward remittances in the name of royalty through the banks, 'without' conducting due diligence and 'without' obtaining any underlying technical collaboration agreement from the company, it said.The ED had earlier seized funds worth Rs 5,551.27 crore of Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited lying in its bank accounts under the FEMA for the 'unauthorised' remittance of this amount in guise of royalty abroad by the company.'The competent authority, appointed under section 37A of the FEMA, has confirmed the said seizure order.

"Apple has been widely expected to offer the periscope lens on one of its upcoming iPhone models but we are yet to see that materialise. And according to Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning an unsurprising approach for the new camera technology on iPhones. Kuo in this post, claims that Apple will bring the periscope lens to the iPhones but only with the iPhone 15 series, so for those who are hoping that the iPhone 14 lineup gets the camera tech, Apple wants you to wait a little longer. Also Read: Here's How Bill Gates Plans To Drop Off The List of Wealthiest PeopleKuo also suggests that Apple will offer the periscope lens on the iPhone 15 Pro Max version, which means people will have to shell out the top buck to use the technology on an iPhone. According to the analyst, Apple will use a 1/3″ sensor for a 12-megapixel resolution camera, offering an f/2.8 aperture, along with sensor-shift stabilisation, and up to 6x of optical zoom.Going by Apple's recent strategy, we are hardly surprised to hear that the periscope lenses will be exclusive to the Pro Max version. Periscope lens has been adopted by Android smartphone brands like Oppo, Vivo and a few more already. But even then, one would have to agree that the prices of these lenses are yet to come down, so brands are forced to include them in the high-end models only. So, Apple might have a strong case for its decision as claimed by Kuo. Also Read: Not Just Twitter, Instagram Suffers Outage As Thousands AffectedThis won't be the first time when the top-end iPhone model has extra features to offer that others in the lineup do not get. One would have assumed that Apple will consider both the Pro and Pro Max on the same pedestal, but Kuo is hinting otherwise. After all, reports suggest that Apple will only offer the new A16 Bionic chipset on the iPhone 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max versions this year, retaining the A15 Bionic for the regular iPhone 14 and the 14 Max models. We are just a few months away from getting our first look at the new iPhones, which hopefully come with a new set of cameras.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News, watch Top Videos and Live TV here.",Apple is going to continue with its premium approach for iPhones in the years to come and it is hardly surprising to see this from the brand.,"Going by Apple's recent strategy, we are hardly surprised to hear that the periscope lenses will be exclusive to the Pro Max version."
"The world is still to emerge from the shock of COVID-19, and no scientist, strategist, or economists can put the finger on a particular solution. We have heard about the flattening of the curve, etc. While about COVID-19 and its end date, we are not sure, but the virus, for sure, is a change agent to our habits, living and working. If we go by estimates presented by various international bodies, we can see a catastrophic impact on jobs, businesses, and governments across the world. According to the WTO, global trade is likely to fall between 13 to 32 per cent in 2020, and every region will suffer a double-digit decline. According to the World Bank, the global GDP is likely to fall between 2.1 and 3.9 per cent. According to the IMF, global growth will fall below -7.4 per cent and, according to their chief economist, the projected global growth in 2020 is likely to fall to - 3 per cent. According to OECD, for every month of lockdown, there will be a loss of 2 percentage points in annual GDP growth. According to ILO, coronavirus is going to impact 2.7 billion workers representing about 81 per cent of the global workforce. Businesses are facing catastrophic losses and, as on April 1, ILO expects that it will impact equivalent to laying off of 195 million full-time workers in the current quarter, and the final tally for 2020 could be far more. Sectors that employ about 1.25 billion workers, representing 38 per cent of the global workforce, are at risk due to severe decline and will have a risk of workforce displacement, particularly low and middle-income countries. About two billion workers are in informal employment, and most of these are in emerging and developing countries, which will be under financial distress due to the impact of COVID-19. India, where 90 per cent work in the informal economy, about 400 million workers are vulnerable and are likely to slide into poverty. A few things don't require assumptions given the reality on the ground, the sentiment emerging from the grim scenario and the uncertainty around the progression of coronavius. The pandemic has proven that countries with higher GDP are not super-powers. They have suffered equally, if not more, and failed to contain the virus. COVID-19 will lead to a resetting of the global supply chains, leading to self-sufficient and inward-looking economies the world over. It is the death of globalisation which the US propagated a few decades ago. Also, this being the election year in the US, will fast-track protectionism. The virus has led to unmasking and unearthing redundancies in the corporate world, and we will be in a more lean and agile world going forward. Given that large segments of populations in lower and middle-income countries are migrant workers, even if the coronavirus recedes by June, workers are not going to return immediately to cities to work in factories. In fact, given their experience and uncertainty during these times, a section of the workers may stay back with their families in their native places. So, manufacturing, construction, travel and tourism and small entrepreneurs will suffer a significant jolt, and it is not going to return to normal by Q4, 2020. The governments which are calling upon the people to bear the pain and not giving adequate financial help should be ready for the mass outburst of anger and violence, and it is a real threat not to be taken likely. One significant change that has happened in this work from home is that business organisations and manufacturing will resort to automation to become independent of such future uncertainties due to such outbreaks. It means, they will resort to automation from reception, assembling to logistics (front end to backend integration). Indiscriminate adoption of automation is where the world faces significant, long-term societal risk. Estimates before COVID-19 have quantified that automation could replace 40 per cent of the total jobs. According to a World Bank publication, 'Smart machines probably won't kill us all—but they'll definitely take our jobs, and sooner than you think,' Jim Yong Kim, Chief of World Bank, said in 2016 that, 'Research based on World Bank data has predicted that the proportion of jobs threatened by automation in India is 69 per cent, 77 per cent in China and as high as 85 per cent in Ethiopia.' A few companies which wanted to lay off people but could not are using pandemic as an excuse to lay off people. Post the COVID-19 shutdown, automation will inevitably get fast-tracked. I think the United Nations should revisit its Sustainable Development goals and correct its mistake by adding another goal, SDG18, 'Responsible Automation.' Mad rush for automation will have a cascading effect, and this is not something the world is prepared for, given that we have 7.7 billion humans to cater to and sustain. Responsible automation is where we need a better understanding of the business community and political leadership that, 'Profits' with the 'proliferation of technology' should not be without 'people.' If we keep people out of the equation, the consequences would undermine all other SDGs and, maybe, render them irrelevant. It is time for the United Nations to have the most critical SDG, 'Sustainable Automation,' as an 'intergenerational goal.' It's better late than never.

"Soon, tipplers can have their favourite drink in cartons instead of bottles in Tamil Nadu. This follows an announcement made by state prohibition and excise minister S Muthusamy that the government is mulling bringing liquor in tetra packs but only after taking the opinion of all political parties.'Many a times, liquor bottles are thrown in farmlands, roads, and outside garbage bins. We can avoid all this if we bring liquor in tetra packs. We will consider the opinion of all political parties and have also sought the opinion of 18 trade unions,' said Muthusamy.Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) officials said the 90-ml tetra packs will be priced between Rs 60 and Rs 70 per unit. 'It will be more affordable for people belonging to lower-income groups and help them stay away from cheap, illicit liquor,' said a senior Tasmac official. Tasmac is the sole liquor seller in Tamil Nadu and is owned by the state government. 'Discussions are underway with manufacturers to produce and package liquor in tetra packs. A detailed project report has been submitted to the state government in this regard,' said the official. He said within 4-5 months, Tasmac is planning to launch popular liquor brands in tetra packs.The first opposition to selling liquor in tetra packs came from the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) which said party cadres would campaign against the move. PMK state president Anbumani Ramadoss said he did not expect an experienced minister like Muthusamy to introduce such a scheme in the state that would adversely affect students and youngsters by increasing the sale of liquor.The former Union minister said Tamil Nadu had to roll back the sale of cheap 100ml packs when it was introduced in 1989 and 2002. He added that minors may mistake the sachets with milk and other beverage packets that are similarly packed. The PMK leader said shutting down liquor shops was the only solution to curb the problem in the state.","The first opposition to selling liquor in tetra packs came from the Pattali Makkal Katchi, with state president Anbumani Ramadoss saying the scheme would adversely affect students and youngsters by increasing the sale of liquor",Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) officials said the 90-ml tetra packs will be priced between Rs 60 and Rs 70 per unit.
"It's not every day that you see a tiger lose grip on his marked territory! It is extremely rare — and when it happens, almost always the tiger falls prey. The Shiv Sena today seems to have not only lost over two-thirds of its elected legislators, but also seems incapable of having enough influence to get its people elected in numbers required to retain or form government. The roaring tiger which used to be synonymous with the formidable Balasaheb Thackeray no longer seems to be an accurate representation of its inheritors: Uddhav and Aaditya. The journey of the Sena from being an indispensable power centre dictating its terms to now having to stoop to the whims of Balasaheb's arch political enemies just to stay relevant is a telling lesson in contemporary Maharashtra politics. This is not an overnight event: Sena's downfall was truly scripted when Uddhav Thackeray began to take control over the party affairs pushing aside mass leaders like Raj Thackeray and Narayan Rane in the years running up to 2003. The warning signs were all there. In his autobiography, Narayan Rane has written how in the 1999 Maharashtra Assembly elections, Uddhav arbitrarily replaced 15 candidates after the entire list had been signed off by Balasaheb, on the advice of his yes-men. The 15 strongmen who were kicked out contested as independents out of which 11 won — the number which would have helped SS+BJP retain government in Maharashtra. Thus, the 1999 defeat of the SS+BJP's loss can be directly attributed to Uddhav's decision making. In 2004 too, the tickets were sold-off like hot cakes to anyone willing to pay the price quoted by the close coterie, leading to an extremely embarrassing defeat of the party where it lost deposits even in Sena strongholds. Episodes of his erratic behaviour towards party workers have been in conversation within Maharashtra's power corridors for a long time — for instance (as also written in Rane's autobiography), he refused to honour his commitment to meet party workers who had come to Mumbai from rural parts of the state, keeping them waiting for days, because he was 'mourning' the death of an expensive fish he had bought in Singapore.Anti-incumbency towards the INC+NCP government combined with the 2014 Narendra Modi wave revived the Sena's fortunes, bringing them back in power under Devendra Fadnavis' chief-ministership. However, Sena under Uddhav remained critical of its own government, widening rifts with its ally. At one point the criticism in their mouthpiece Saamna got so loud and regular that many wondered why they didn't show the courage to just walk out of the government which they were so unhappy with. Disgruntled with the hypocrisy, the Sena ministers and several elected leaders defied the party's diktat and continued to work in close cooperation under Fadnavis' leadership. Here is where Eknath Shinde really experienced power, holding key portfolios working in close alliance with the BJP, maintaining a tight grip on the Sena MLAs and ministers in the Fadnavis cabinet. Come 2019, considering the camaraderie between the Sena ministers (under Shinde's leadership) and his own and the pace of developmental initiatives in the state which could be attributed to that team-spirit, Fadnavis tried to accommodate Uddhav's unreasonable demands during their conversations regarding forming a pre-poll alliance. Fadnavis even offered Uddhav his choice of 124 seats, many of which were BJP strongholds to demonstrate his commitment to the alliance. However, the greed for the Chief Minister's post dictated many of Uddhav's following actions, namely the unnatural alliance with his father's political foes — INC+NCP — abandoning the Hindutva ideology, the very core on which Balasaheb had founded the Shiv Sena (Shiva's army in literal translation).What Uddhav seemed to have forgotten is that his lust for power isolated the core Maharashtrian party voter who showered their affection on him only due to their allegiance to his late father. Compounded with this was the dissatisfaction among MLAs due to the stepfatherly treatment meted out to them as compared to INC+NCP legislators for whom doors to Matoshree and Varsha always seemed accessible and funds always seemed to come through. On the other hand, Sena MLAs found themselves stranded outside the power structures, having to beg for funds for their constituencies and a few minutes of conversational time with their Chief Minister. Many of them had contested against the INC+NCP leaders in the same constituencies; hence, the inter-party resentment kept building and there seemed only one man in the party who emerged as a sounding board for the Sena legislators and truly understood their grievances — Eknath Shinde. He heard their problems, helped arrange funds for development works in their constituencies, enquired about their well-being and problem-solved day-to-day constituency issues for each legislator. With the passage of time, the reality of the Sena leaders became more and more distant from their Chief Minister's ivory tower positions. Lately, Uddhav Thackeray has been consistently stating in his emotional virtual speeches that if the party thinks he is not capable of leading, he will be happy to step down. Over two-thirds of his legislators have abandoned him for about a week — how much more proof does he need? They have shown no intent to return to Uddhav's leadership, his new ideologies and new allies. During Balasaheb's iron-hand leadership this scale of unapologetic, outright 'bagaavat' was unthinkable. Since they are in majority it is only obvious they are the true heirs of Balasaheb's teachings, ideology and political legacy — long abandoned by the current, next gen Thackerays.

"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, who started his campaign with the Vijay Rath Yatra from Kanpur on October 12, spoke to CNN News18 at the Hamirpur Circuit House about his 'big' agenda for poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.Reminiscing about his experience in alliance politics, the former chief minister asserted that the Samajwadi Party will not have any tie-up with 'bigger parties'. 'I don't think SP will have any alliance with Congress or BSP.' He also said the ruling 'BJP knows SP is the real challenge' and therefore it is trying to create false perception about Congress increasing strength in Uttar Pradesh.Here are the excerpts from the interview:What is this slogan - 'change to cycle in 2022'?We stand for change bringing relief to farmers, youth and people of UP. The BJP government has failed on every front of the promise it made in its manifesto. The way business and trade have collapsed, this Vijay Rath is to ensure justice to them. Samajwadi Party's Vijay Rath will continuously move with masses.What is the big agenda of your campaign?Look at the way the farmers have been crushed. The farmer income has not increased… we promise a change in farmers' life. Not a single new unit of power production has happened in the state. High power tariff is crushing the farmers and businesses. We promise changes in power reform and free electricity to farmers. Jobs for youth and putting UP on the growth path is our agenda. During the five years of BJP rule, Dalits and minorities have been humiliated and subjected to atrocities. Samajwadi party will undo this injustice.You had once said that you are not looking forward to bigger parties. The leader of that bigger party is now very active in UP.UP election is about the people of UP. People want change. In a democracy, every party has the right to campaign but people know whom to vote for. BJP should not hope much as people have already made up their mind.But don't you think trifurcation of non-BJP vote is a challenge?The BJP should not be concerned about that. People have decided for change and they know whose government had actually done the work on the ground. SP is going to make a clean sweep.In 2017 and 2019, you entered into an alliance. Are you keeping alliance options open now?Our experience of alliances with bigger parties had been bitter. We therefore now look forward to bringing in smaller parties together and not the bigger ones.Have all possibilities of alliances with Congress closed now?I don't think SP will have any alliance with Congress or BSP.Ajay Mishra Teni's resignation as a minister has not yet taken place.I was the first to speak to the injured farmer leader. Samajwadi Party Farmers of UP have decided to wipe out the BJP and they see the hope in Samajwadi Party.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's detention, and then allowing Rahul Gandhi and her to visit Lakhimpur Kheri, don't you think BJP is purposely giving projection to the Congress?BJP's strategy is being seen by the people. BJP knows that SP is the real challenge. And therefore they are trying to create confusion, create wrong perceptions. But all these strategies will fail.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.","Akhilesh Yadav said farmers, jobs for youth and justice for Dalits and minorities would be the agenda of the Samajwadi Party for the election campaign.",
"At a central square in Kharkiv, a slogan greets visitors 'We're Together, We're Kharkiv'. On the face of it, it looks like a gung-ho slogan one would expect to see in a country fighting a war but Kharkiv also holds answers to some important and key questions surrounding the war narrative.A banner hung in the central square of Kharkiv reads 'We're Together, We're Kharkiv' (Image: Sanjay Suri/CNN-News18)The slogan also speaks a hard political truth and shows that this is not a mere slogan. The 'we' in Kharkiv means people who are predominantly Russian speaking and they are an overwhelming majority in the city which was recently liberated from Russian troops.But Russian-speaking Kharkiv burst into celebrations when Russian troops were defeated and forced to depart.Language and LoyaltyTo be Russian speaking and to be Russian are quite different matters. The inability to see that, or to accept it if he sees it, lies at the heart of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine.However, this is not just applicable to Kharkiv, it applies to everyone living along eastern belt of Ukraine, particularly the Donbas region, that includes primarily the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.Most people living in this belt speak Russian, just like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who can speak both Ukrainian and Russian with ease.But by Putin's logic, Zelensky should be a Russia loyalist - since he speaks Russian - and so should everyone living along Ukraine's eastern belt.SovietThe old Soviet umbrella over both Russia and Ukraine under Moscow's writ explains much of this.'We had a lot of Russian schools in Ukraine before, so a lot of people speak Russian, Mariia tells CNN-News18. 'We just got used to the language. But all people support Ukraine and want to live in Ukraine. Nobody wants to be Russian.'Sasha in Saltivka suburb of Kharkiv sits across two languages but not two loyalties.'When I heard explosions on February 24, I could not believe the war had started,' he tells CNN-News18. 'Russians came here and fired artillery into our homes. Nobody could understand who needed this and why.'Sasha says that like most people there he speaks both Ukrainian and Russian. 'But we hate Russians,' Sasha adds.AnswerKharkiv does have the simple answer to that important question. Putin faces opposition from the very people he claims are his and that he has set out to own.It was visible in Kharkiv and the same sentiment could well surface in Donbas region. Putin claims that in these regions the prevailing sentiment is 'Russia Forever' but it could slowly turn to 'Russia Never' as the war rages on.Read all the Latest News here","According to Russian President Putin, people living in the eastern region of Ukraine speak Russian, hence should support Moscow, but Russian-speaking Kharkiv chooses to differ",
"As always, when team India travels overseas, there is certain intrigue around its preparations. This past week, the squad was camped in Perth for its weeklong acclimatisation with the Australian conditions. And of course, there were two practice matches scheduled as well.Practice or warm-up games are a strange phenomenon for team India. They are not given much credence, and this line of thinking has been prevalent since the time of MS Dhoni and coach Duncan Fletcher. They created an atmosphere wherein more credence was laid upon net sessions, throw downs from coaches/specialists, and intra-team contests. First-Class games as preparation have become a rarity since, and this mode of preparation is prevalent even today.ALSO READ: India and Pakistan Not To Play Any Bilateral Series Till 2027And so, Virat Kohli skipped both practice games against Western Australia, instead choosing for match-wicket practice. KL Rahul didn't bat in the first game, Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav didn't bat in the second game. Rishabh Pant, who is not expected to feature in India's first choice playing eleven during this upcoming T20 World Cup, opened in both practice matches. Go figure!This isn't about India's batting though. Going into this T20 World Cup, their key strength - and hope - is batting prowess. Yes, there are doubts after last year's embarrassment. Yes, there is an unstated imbalance about a complete right-handed batting line-up. Even so, those are big names and India's claim for a second T20 World Cup title rests on their shoulders.This, instead, is about that bowling line-up, which still isn't ready. The tournament's qualifying round begins on Sunday, and India's first game is precisely ten days away (at the time of writing), and yet, there is no 15th member of the squad still. It is an incomplete squad, wherein Jasprit Bumrah's replacement is still missing.Sure, you cannot really replace Bumrah's value in T20 cricket. But a timely effort to find an alternative could have been fruitful in the grander scheme of things. Yes, Mohammed Shami got Covid-19 and his late recovery further hampered plans. The question here is if he really is the answer to this problem. Mind you, Shami hasn't played T20Is since the embarrassing exit from the 2021 World Cup.Then, there is Mohammed Siraj, who until recently was playing county cricket in England. Shami's illness meant he was rushed back into India's white-ball plans and took a while to get going. You want to ask herein, why Umesh Yadav isn't in consideration? After all, he was the first replacement for Shami, an open admission from the team management that they forgot pace as a potent weapon in Australia.Why isn't he in contention still?Further, there is the curious case of Shardul Thakur. He was not in the original list of reserves. Deepak Chahar's back injury propelled him into India's plans for touring Down Under, and now he is on the bench as backup for Hardik Pandya. It needs to be recalled here that Pandya missed the South Africa T20I series to undergo conditioning work at the NCA. Is there something the team management isn't saying out loud?You could wonder the same when Arshdeep Singh missed one game due to a worrisome back issue. It is almost as if India's front-line T20I bowlers are all walking on one leg, or not walking at all. In essence, this is gross mismanagement from the selectors. Even so, while India is performing complex mathematics to find five fit fast bowlers for this World Cup, there are no credible answers forthcoming from the selectors.As such, the question to ask at this juncture is a simple one. What seems to be India's first-choice bowling plan for the tournament opener against Pakistan?Ten days away from the game, as things stand, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Arshdeep Singh seem to be first-choice bowlers. Both bowled with the new ball in these two practice games, and more pertinently, didn't bowl their full quota of overs. Comparing notes with India's previous preparatory camps and/or practice games, it is quite an indicator of the management's thinking - a right/left combination to start things off, with Hardik Pandya also helping out in the powerplay.ALSO READ: NZ vs Pak, Tri-Series: Asif Ali Limps Out of Ground; Pakistan Face Injury ScareThis though seems to be just the starting point. Much will be decided from the two warm-up games between Australia and New Zealand as well. At this point, Shami is the frontline choice to replace Bumrah. And if he is eventually drafted into the squad, he will definitely share the new ball as well as bowl most of his overs in the powerplay or the first half of the innings. That relegates Arshdeep to the middle and death overs.That leaves Harshal Patel and the composition of India's spin attack. While R Ashwin is getting good game time off late, Yuzvendra Chahal and Axar Patel should still be the starting spin attack. Patel's inclusion depends on Shami's fitness as also how well Arshdeep performs his roles in the initial stages of the World Cup. Beyond that, it is a matter of control, something India hasn't ascertained on opposition batsmen lately.It was something seen against South Africa, as David Miller and Rilee Rossouw smacked hundreds in the final two games. More of this was seen against Western Australia XI. In the first practice game, they were reduced to 12-4 in 2.4 overs and yet India conceded 133 in 17.1 overs at 7.78 per over. In the second practice game, the hosts started well again, scoring at almost 8 per over before Ashwin struck late.This lack of control compounded issues in the second game when the chase simply didn't kick off. Losing to Western Australia XI, even in a practice game, should ring alarm bells. Anything else is just plain complacency, or worse, carelessness.Get the latest Cricket News, Schedule and Cricket Live Scores here","Ten days away from the game, as things stand, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Arshdeep Singh seem to be first-choice bowlers-with Hardik Pandya also helping out in the powerplay",

"Adequate nutrition is critical for women's health and the health of their children. Breaking the intergenerational cycle of undernutrition is one of the key ways to eliminate malnutrition in India. As indicative in figure 1, under-nourished women, in all likelihood, become under-nourished mothers with a greater chance of giving birth to underweight babies who grow into stunted children with reduced mental capacity, have lower resistance to infections and higher risk of morbidity and mortality throughout their lives.Figure 1: Poor Nutrition throughout the life cycleAbout one in five women (18.7 per cent) of reproductive age (15-49 years) in India are thin, with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5 kilograms per square metre, perpetuating an intergenerational cycle of malnutrition. The proportion is higher in rural areas (21.2 per cent) than in urban areas (13.1 per cent). Almost a quarter of women (23.3 per cent) are married before they turn 18. Inadequate nutrition before conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy is largely responsible for foetal stunting. Investing in maternal and child health yields a high cost to benefit ratio, with a triple dividend in both low- and upper-middle income countries.The government of India has taken significant measures to combat malnutrition over the past few decades through the Integrated Child Development Scheme and the Anganwadi system — to provide supplementary nutrition and ration to pregnant and lactating women, run mid-day meal scheme in schools and maternity benefit programme, and mandate provision of grains at subsidised rates through the public distribution system (PDS). The National Food Security Act 2013 assures food and nutrition security to the vulnerable and that access to food is a legal right. India's flagship programme 'POSHAN Abhiyaan' launched on the International Women's Day in 2018 aims to improve nutritional outcomes for children, pregnant women and lactating mothers.Despite all efforts and programmes, women's health and education continue to be neglected. There is an intersection of low education in women, poverty and malnutrition. According to World Bank, educating girls and ending child marriage are central to eradicating poverty. The UN's sustainable development goals call for gender equality and access to quality education by 2030. Education enables socioeconomic mobility and is therefore the key to escaping poverty.With women constituting almost half of India's population at 48 per cent and contributing 18 per cent to the GDP, a lot needs to be done to address the challenges faced by women. The COVID-19 crisis has led to women bearing the double brunt of economic and social fallout. According to the World Bank, the pandemic has pushed another 150 million people into extreme poverty. This calls for effective implementation of programmes and allocation of budget.The Union Budget 2021-22 was disheartening with reduced allocation for crucial social security programmes for women and children despite the challenges faced by women due to the pandemic. The budget of the Ministry of Women and Child Development was reduced by 0.7 per cent. Mission POSHAN 2.0 was launched to strengthen nutritional content, delivery and outcome; however, the budget allocation for the POSHAN scheme showed a steep decline of 27 per cent (from Rs 3700 crore to Rs 2700 crore).Despite less-than-remarkable implementation of POSHAN Abhiyaan, POSHAN 2.0 was launched by clubbing schemes under SAKSHAM and SAMARTHYA. The budget was lowest for children at 2.46 per cent. The gender budget trends were underwhelming. The schemes were not given their due in the budget, with a drastic slash in maternity entitlement scheme. The estimates were revised by 48 per cent leaving out half of the women beneficiaries.This shows poor implementation of schemes leading to a decline in beneficiaries availing it. Budget allocations also seem to neglect adolescent nutrition even as data indicates high micronutrient deficiencies and poor nutritional status among them. Schemes for adolescent girls that address their health and nutrition call for higher allocation and strengthened implementation to improve the declining coverage. Another drastic decline (from Rs 726 crore to Rs 48 crore) was seen in the Mission for Protection and Empowerment of Women, indicating sheer neglect of vulnerable women and girls as against the expectation of transformative opportunity. According to experts, 'the Budget announced POSHAN Mission 2.0 (but it) would be effective only if feeding and not mere provision gets the budget share.' Budget 2021 seemed to have paid a lip service to women's health and nutrition.Union Budget 2022-23 looks to continue to focus on 'agriculture, rural connectivity, drinking water mission, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India mission), nutrition, and health and education, including mid-day meal scheme'. There is an urgent need to invest in women and children's health for sustainable development along with saving lives and improving quality of life. Focus on 'Gender Budgeting' is needed as it has multi-sectoral impact on lives of women and girls.We must continue to invest in programmes targeting social protection, early child development, education, and water and sanitation to enhance effectiveness of nutrition-specific interventions. With the disruption of nutritional services during the pandemic due to loss of livelihoods, it is essential to provide for the needs of the nation. The relief package under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana for the poorest of poor needs to be continued and budgeted along with universalisation of PDS. Finally, the budget should allocate sufficient funds for women's health, maternity entitlements and safety — for economic growth.Hoping for a budget with transformational reforms for women and girls for an inclusive and equitable post-COVID recovery.Dr Shoba Suri is a Senior Fellow with ORF's Health Initiative.

"Not many people knew Chunni Lal, a resident of the border village of Makwal in Jammu district, until home minister Amit Shah visited the BSF border outpost late Sunday evening and happened to sit at his house for tea.Shah became the second home minister in the Modi government to visit the Makwal post on the Indo-Pak International Border after Rajnath Singh who inaugurated the integrated smart fencing equipment to keep a check on the cross-border infiltration.A sleepy village sitting next to the Indo-Pak border, Makwal used to get its share of publicity only during the ceasefire violations when the BSF and Pakistan rangers used to exchange mortars.As the home minister was leaving the border outpost after being briefed by the senior BSF officials about the measures put in place by the force to check cross-border infiltration, Shah stopped at the nearby village to have a look at the community bunkers being built for the civilian population of the area.The sudden halt in the village surprised everybody. Shah went inside one of the bunkers and was briefed by the local administration about the steps being taken to safeguard civilian life and property in the event of renewed hostilities between the border guarding force of both the countries.Peeping from the gate of his modest house was Chunni Lal who along with his family were watching the home minister as the police had instructed the family to not open the gate. 'I was just watching from the gate when the home minister saw me. He asked for my permission to come inside. I told him that he is more than welcome to come inside,' an excited Chunni Lal tells CNN News18.Lal said he offered Shah a chair to sit, however, he refused and instead said he would prefer sitting on a charpoy (traditional cot made of jute). 'He told me he would like to sit on a charpoy as it has been too long…,' Lal said.Lal says the home minister asked him to sit next to him on the cot and started asking about his profession, 'he asked me what I was doing, I told him that I am a daily wage employee and my son works as a conductor.'When the minister asked Lal if he had cattle at home, Lal said he has a buffalo, which two litres of milk. 'Then the home minister asked us to make a cup of tea for him, first he asked for a glass of water and then tea'.Lal says Shah also took his mobile number and saved his own number in his phone and asked him to call 'anytime' if he needs to speak to him.'He was soft-spoken and humble, he made my entire family feel at ease,' Lal said.Chunni has been receiving calls from relatives ever since Amit Shah visited his house, and people have been seeing him with boxes of sweets to congratulate him.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.","Chunni Lal said he offered Amit Shah a chair, however, he refused and instead said he would prefer sitting on a charpoy.

"The Centre may soon ask drugmakers to print or affix bar codes or QR codes on the packets of medicines to help find out and trace genuine drug products, News18.com has learnt. The move holds relevance as it will eliminate the challenge of counterfeit products or fake medicines being sold in India. According to an earlier estimate by the World Health Organization (WHO), around 35 per cent fake drugs sold globally come from India.'All preparations have been done and the move is likely to be implemented within the next few weeks,' a government official privy to the development told News18.com. 'As the move will be mandatory, we are discussing if select medicines could undergo the barcoding in the first phase followed by the entire pharma industry later. Hence, a list of top selling 300 brands will be released which will first adopt the QR or barcode mandate in the first round.'These brands would include the top-selling popular medicines in the Indian pharma market such as Allegra, Dolo, Augmentin, Saridon, Calpol, and Thyronorm among others. 'Once the first phase goes off smoothly, we will go for all high volume molecules,' the source said, adding that the government is exploring setting up of a central database agency where India can have a single bar code provider for the entire industry.How will barcoding work? In the draft notification issue in June, the government said the manufacturers of the formulation products will print or affix bar codes or quick response codes on their primary packaging label and on the secondary package label that store data or information legible with software applications to facilitate authentication.The stored data or information shall include a unique product identification code, proper and generic name of the drug, brand name, name and address of the manufacturer, batch number, date of manufacturing, date of expiry and manufacturing license number. Why does India need barcodes?In 2019, the United States has warned India of its growing problem of counterfeit or spurious drugs.In its annual 'Special 301 Report' on intellectual property protection and review of 'notorious markets' for piracy and counterfeiting, the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) blamed India for its growing problem of counterfeit medicines.It said that almost 20 per cent of all pharmaceutical goods sold in the Indian market are counterfeit, a damning claim considering the growing pharmaceutical market of India and its decades-old reputation of being the 'pharmacy to the world'.While the move to roll out bar codes was in the making since 2016, it is likely to be implemented now. News18.com had reported in March 2022 that the office of Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had instructed the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to 'make India free of spurious and poor quality medicines'. The move to make coding mandatory is in sync with the minister's instructions.Read all the Latest News India and Breaking News here","In 2019, the United States warned India of its growing problem of spurious drugs and claimed that almost 20 per cent of all pharmaceutical goods sold in the Indian market are counterfeit",

"Amazon has added the newest and by far the most powerful Fire TV Stick device to the line-up. It is called the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max and you can now preorder this in India. The price tag is Rs 6,499 and expect shipping to happen to around October 7, which is when the Fire TV Stick 4K Max gets officially released on the store. The headline changes include a faster processor working under the hood, the addition of Wi-Fi 6 network support, a bit more RAM and something called the Live View Picture in Picture feature. Incidentally, this is the most expensive Fire TV Stick device in the line-up, sitting above the Fire TV Stick 4K in the hierarchy, with the Fire TV Cube as the flagship product.The Fire TV Stick 4K Max gets a MediaTek MT8696 quad core processor clocking at 1.8GHz. There's 2GB RAM as well. In comparison, the Fire TV Stick 4K which is ideally succeeds, is powered by a 1.7GHz processor and has 1.5GB RAM. Expect snappier interface switches, OTT streaming app load times and better handling of 4K content, in particular fast-moving visuals. The internal storage space, with is 8GB, remains the same as before. So is the support for HDR including Dolby Vision across OTT streaming apps including Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar as well as the ability to handle Dolby Atmos audio.The other big change with the Fire TV Stick 4K Max in comparison with the Fire TV Stick 4K is the addition of support for Wi-Fi 6 networks. You probably better know this as Wi-Fi AX. As with every new Wi-Fi standard upgrade, there is the promise for better speeds and coverage, something that becomes relevant in this case because of 4K video streaming. To put numbers, Wi-Fi 6 touches a theoretical network top speed of 9.6Gbps, up from the ceiling of 3.5Gbps on Wi-Fi 5, or Wi-Fi AC. However, you'll only be able to take advantage of this new Wi-Fi prowess if you have a Wi-Fi router at home, that is creating a Wi-Fi AX band at home. It's the newer routers which do this, and if you haven't upgraded to a powerful (read premium price tag) router in the last 12 months or so, your router probably doesn't have Wi-Fi 6 support.The Live View Picture in Picture option is bringing the Fire TV Stick 4K Max ever closer to your smart home, in case you already have that in place. This option allows you to view a live feed from your smart security cameras on your TV, as an overlay over whatever it is that you are already watching—great if the doorbell has just sounded and you want to see who is at the door. Plus, the Alexa Voice Remote can be used to control compatible smart home gadgets as well as smart plugs.There is no doubt that the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is ticking off the simplicity and convenience that you'd expect from an Amazon Fire TV Stick device. The Alexa Voice Remote has controls for TV as well as shortcut keys for Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. You will get access to the redesigned home screen out of the box. And this still plugs directly into an HDMI port on the back of your TV, for easiest setup and use. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max priced at Rs 6,499 is a tad bit more expensive than the Fire TV Stick 4K which is currently priced at Rs 5,999. Yet, there remains little doubt that the Amazon Fire TV Stick family of media streaming devices remain your best bet to access OTT streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar and more, on your TV.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Assembly Elections Live Updates here.","The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max priced at Rs 6,499 is a tad bit more expensive than the Fire TV Stick 4K which is currently priced at Rs 5,999.",

"The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds came. They conquered. And they went back. Looked at the bank account, and the immediate realisation was that prudence was the best policy. Luckily, the Germans are back. Sennheiser has the new CX 400BT ready in the arsenal, and it didn't really take long to understand and absorb that these comparatively more affordable wireless earbuds are actually more inspired from the significantly more expensive yet absolutely brilliant Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds, than you may imagine at first. That is a great foundation to build on for the Sennheiser CX 400BT that are priced at Rs 16,990 which is almost Rs 10,000 lesser than the more expensive sibling. At a time when everyone wants true wireless earbuds, or TWS as they are often referred to as, having earbuds options at multiple price points is a good strategy to have in this increasingly competitive space.At this price of Rs 16,990 at this time, the Sennheiser CX 400BT competes with the likes of the Sony WF-1000XM3, the Jabra Elite Active 75t and Apple AirPods. The Sennheiser CX 400BT's arsenal includes the same 7mm audio drivers as the Momentum True Wireless 2, support for aptX audio codecs, the long battery life and the typical Sennheiser sound signature. If you are going purely on the features list, then the Sony WF-1000XM3 does have an advantage of active noise cancellation as well as location-based features that can manage the ANC based on what you may be doing at the time. But if you don't need noise cancellation or prefer the Sennheiser sound signature, the Sennheiser CX 400BT could very well be your port of call. Design: Simplicity Makes All The Difference, Either WayAs far as the design goes, wear these the first time and you'll know why Sennheiser didn't have to integrate active noise cancellation in these buds. The fit, assuming you have picked the perfect ear tips size, provides close to leakage-free fit in the ear canal. This can pretty well block out most ambient noise around you, if you like to stay isolated from the ambient din. Do remember to twist-to-fit for these to sit snugly. It is not active noise cancellation, but in the real world, it is very close to that sort of end result. What you will miss is a listening mode or some sort of transparency options in case someone walks up to you to have a quick word, and you'll have to take the earbuds out. At least one bud. Not the smallest buds by any stretch of the imagination, and these stick out of the ear a bit. It isn't a problem for me, but for some users, they may prefer something more discreet as the bean-shaped Samsung Galaxy Buds Live instead. The Sennheiser CX 400BT earbuds have plastic body, yet very good quality. These don't feel lightweight in the quality sense, have a nice solidity to the build yet remain light enough to comfortably sit inside your ears for a while without any discomfort. The buds themselves have a dual tone finish, with matte on the sides and glossy black on the outside where the touch controls are—you can completely customize the controls. That's where the Sennheiser logo also sits, something that you will absolutely not mind showing off to fellow human beings.But it must be noted that the Sennheiser CX 400BT is most certainly not the best looking earbuds out there. It is understated, gets the fit aspect right but it isn?t going to get any attention. The safer colour choice of black and white plays its role too. There is no aura that some other earbuds have, and these will most likely not have the sort of immediacy in recognition that the Apple AirPods do, for instance. None of these are drawback unless all you are going for is style, mind you. The charging case itself has quite a bit of bulk. In a way as chunky as the Sony WF-1000XM3 in a slightly different form factor, but it shouldn't be much of a problem carrying this in trouser pockets. Nevertheless, it has to be noted that the Jabra Elite Active 75t has a much smaller charging case.Performance: You Will Love That The Sennheiser Sound Has Not ChangedEven though there are changes on the outside, what sits inside the Sennheiser CX 400BT are the same 7mm audio drivers in each ear. The same as the flagship Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds. It builds the sound experience with the typical neutral Sennheiser sound signature, similar tuning and the same sound processing to really up the game in a price segment that now the Sennheiser CX 400BT competing directly with the Sony WF-1000XM3 as far as the vibrant sound exprience is concerned. What the Sennheiser CX 400BT builds from is a neutral sound signature. Absolutely neutral, no artificial boost for any frequency range on the EQ and no intention to add glitter where there is none as the track originally is. With this, what you get is the flexibility across content and music genres. The Sennheiser CX 400BT isn't playing in the price band that should see a lot of buyers looking purely for bass. This is for the more discerning listeners who may not have the budget to splurge around Rs 25,000 on a Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 but still want to get as close to the experience as possible. With the CX 400BT, Sennheiser have done that. Very effectively. In the world of smartphones, we would perhaps refer to something like this as an 'affordable flagship'. You get the drift. In terms of content, there isn't just music on the radar anymore. There are the more vocal intensive content consumption patterns as well, including podcasts and also lot of binge watching on streaming apps such as Netflix, Amazon Video and Disney+ Hotstar. All through, the Sennheiser CX 400BT effortlessly gets the job done. I had noted during my Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds review that everything is just so nicely rounded off, that you don't feel anything is missing, any harshness or any sort of artificial tuning or boosting. The finer details really shine though, and you'll notice that soon enough. All of that applies to the Sennheiser CX 400BT, as is. That being said, if you listen to lower quality audio files, you may notice some sharpness with the vocals at higher volumes.And if and when you do want to make changes, the Sennheiser Smart Control app (available for Android and iPhone) will let you tweak the EQ as you like it. The good thing is, Sennheiser heard collective feedback and have added a traditional EQ interface in addition to the visually more appealing but also more complicated wave interface.Battery life is a strong point of the Sennheiser CX 400BT. The claim is for 7 hours from the earbuds, and up to 20 hours more from the charging case. In my tests, and I usually keep the volume well in check, I actually clocked the 7-hour mark with ease. Dial up the volume, and this may reduce by a few minutes. Still, this will work well for travel, a day at work or even for the weekend binge watching sessions.The Last Word: It Is A Big Battle With The Sony WF-1000XM3We have already illustrated that the Sennheiser CX 400BT has tough competition. Straight up on the spec sheet, it misses active noise cancellation. You may feel it's a big miss, but really, it isn't. If you'd really want ANC still, the Sony WF-1000XM3 are yours to pick then. But for the rest who don't really care much about noise cancellation, the Sennheiser CX 400BT is replicating the sort of premium audio experience that its significantly more expensive sibling earbuds offer.

"The BJP's landslide win in the 2022 Gujarat assembly election sends out a clear message: divide and rule. Unless the Opposition unites nationally to avoid triangular contests like Gujarat, it will face defeat in the 2024 Lok Sabha election.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) cannibalised enough vote share in Gujarat to ensure the Congress' decimation. AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal's mission was to lose this battle in order to win a future war. But by ending up with a handful of seats and modest vote share, Kejriwal's objective to replace Congress as the main Opposition party in Gujarat has backfired. He has demolished the Congress and at the same time exposed AAP's electoral vulnerability in a state like Gujarat.Gujarat is not Punjab or Delhi. Kejriwal miscalculated in Himachal Pradesh as well. Despite a fevered though fractious campaign, AAP drew a blank.The big Congress win in Himachal underscores that in a binary contest the BJP can be defeated. While AAP was a factor in Himachal, it had committed most of its resources to Gujarat, making Himachal effectively a one-on-one contest between the Congress and BJP.Himachal maintained its record of rotating governments every five years but its message to the BJP is clear: dynasties like the Dhumals which dominate the state have an expiry date.How can the Gujarat and Himachal results be extrapolated to the 2024 Lok Sabha election? Three key points stand out.One, unless the national Opposition unites against the BJP, it will lose the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, handing Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third successive term.Two, Kejriwal's bid to unite the Opposition will run into a Congress and Trinamool Congress wall. Both Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee are wary of Kejriwal positioning himself as a post-Modi era prime ministerial alternative.Three, Mamata and Rahul share poor personal chemistry. Their animus towards Modi may drive them to make common cause in 2024. But the putative mahagathbandhan will unravel over the combined Opposition's choice of a prime ministerial face.Other prime ministerial — or kingmaker — hopefuls like K Chandrashekar Rao, Nitish Kumar, and Naveen Patnaik will be more concerned about safeguarding their regional fiefs than putting all their eggs in the mahagathbandhan basket.Perversely, a stronger Kejriwal in Delhi and Punjab and a dominant Mamata in West Bengal will work in the BJP's favour: strong regional satraps rarely make good national Opposition electoral partners.The 2024 Lok Sabha election will be won in the states. This is where the BJP could face headwinds. In the 2019 general election, the BJP made a clean sweep of Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan (25/25), Gujarat (26/26), Uttarakhand (5/5), Himachal Pradesh (4/4), Haryana (10/10), and Delhi (7/7). In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP won 62 out of 80 seats, in Karnataka 25 out of 28 seats, and in Madhya Pradesh 27 out of 29 seats.Maharashtra and Bihar could be crucial. In both, the BJP's alliance partners - the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and JD(U) in Bihar - have walked away. In 2019, the BJP won 23 seats in Maharashtra and 17 seats in Bihar. The BJP-Shinde alliance government in Maharashtra has to weather both a pending Supreme Court verdict on its legitimacy and divisions in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena vote. In Bihar, the JD(U)-RJD combine will pose a challenge to the BJP.The BJP knows the danger Opposition unity poses. It lost Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh (before wrenching it back), and Chhattisgarh in December 2018. It was heading towards 250-260 seats in the April-May 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The Pulwama terror attack and India's air strike in Balakot in February 2019 lifted the BJP past 300 seats.Modi is arguably in a much stronger position today than in early 2019. The country's infrastructure projects, digital thrust, post-Covid handling of the economy, and presidency of the G20 have given him a global pulpit.However, several challenging assembly elections await him in 2023. Among them, five are key: Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh. The BJP looks vulnerable in Karnataka despite the attempt by the local Congress leadership of DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah to self-destruct. Against that though, is chief minister BS Bommai's charmless leadership.Turn now to the hard maths. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the BJP won 231 of its 303 seats in just 11 states: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Delhi.The Opposition sees opportunities in 2024 in Maharashtra, Bihar, Karnataka, and Delhi. But in a Lok Sabha election, it's Modi versus the rest. And Modi has two arrows in his quiver.The first is India's year-long G20 presidency which will cement his stature as a global statesman. As soon as India hands over the G20's presidency to Brazil on December 1, 2023, the second arrow in Modi's quiver will be pulled out and aimed squarely in the direction of Ayodhya.The Ram Mandir will open to devotees in December 2023. The official inauguration is scheduled for January 2024.For the Opposition, the timing couldn't be worse. As soon as he hands over the G20 baton, Modi will shift gears into campaign mode for the 2024 Lok Sabha election. The first major campaign rally could be held in Ayodhya against the backdrop of the Ram Mandir. The symbolism will not go unnoticed.For the Opposition, the hope is that regional leaders set their egos and ambitions aside. If they don't — as they did not in Gujarat — they could face a rout in 2024.The writer is editor, author and publisher.

"South Korea's Samsung Display has filed a lawsuit against BOE Technology, accusing the Chinese rival of infringing five of its patents for displays used in mobile devices including Apple's iPhone 12.Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics, asked a federal jury in Texas to award damages for the infringement of patents regarding organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays supplied by BOE. Samsung also seeks an injunction from the court to halt the import and sale of the affected displays.The case was filed on Wednesday with the U.S. court in East Texas, which has a reputation for quicker hearings and decisions on cases.Apple has been using OLED displays on some of its Apple Watch and iPhone models, including the latest iPhone 14. Apple says OLED delivers high resolution and allows for a thinner display than a traditional display.The OLED display market is dominated by Samsung Display, with BOE narrowing the gap, overtaking South Korea's LG Display as the No. 2 player last year, according to market researcher Omdia.'Samsung Display has suffered, and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm as a result of Defendants' infringement of the '599 Patent' for which there is no adequate remedy at law, unless Defendants' infringement is enjoined by this Court,' the lawsuit says, referring to the 599 patent, which improves the image quality of a device.In December, Samsung Display filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, alleging patent infringement by numerous companies selling OLED screens as replacement displays for mobile devices, triggering an investigation by the agency.Samsung and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comments.Samsung Display executive Choi Kwon-young said in January last year that the company was actively seeking ways to receive compensation for its intellectual property, in a response to an analyst question about rising competition in the mobile OLED screen market.South Korea is a manufacturing powerhouse for items ranging from chips and displays to automobiles, but South Korean companies have been facing a growing threat from rivals in China.Last month, a former executive at Samsung Electronics was indicted on suspicion of stealing company technology for a copycat chip factory in China and jeopardising national economic security, prosecutors said.","South Korea's Samsung Display has filed a lawsuit against BOE Technology, accusing the Chinese rival of infringing five of its patents for displays used in mobile devices including Apple's iPhone 12.",Samsung Display asked a federal jury in Texas to award damages for the infringement of patents regarding organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays supplied by BOE.
"The new IT rules that were published by the government of India comes into effect on Wednesday, May 26, and directly impacts social media companies operating in India. With the likes of Facebook and Twitter having massive presence in India, the deadline seemingly puts the companies at risk of being banned in the country. However, there has been no clarity or official announcements from the central government regarding whether they would seek to impose a ban on platforms that are accessed by crores in India everyday. On this note, a Facebook spokesperson has seemingly hinted that while the company does 'aim to comply' with the new IT rules, it would likely only do so after clarifying 'issues which need more engagement with the government.'A Facebook spokesperson said in a statement, 'We aim to comply with the provisions of the IT rules and continue to discuss a few of the issues which need more engagement with the government. Pursuant to the IT rules, we are working to implement operational processes and improve efficiencies. Facebook remains committed to people's ability to freely and safely express themselves on our platform.' Specific questions addressed to Facebook India by News18 remained unanswered at the time of publishing of the story.When News18 reached out to Twitter, a Twitter India spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. The new IT rules had underlined that each social media company with over 5 million active users in India will have to appoint a grievance redressal officer, a nodal contact person and a chief compliance officer - all based in the country itself. While the nodal contact officer will serve as the first point of contact and company representative to the Indian government, the chief compliance officer will be charged with ensuring that companies remain aligned with the laws of the land. The grievance redressal officer, meanwhile, will be required to address all grievances filed by users within 24 hours, and issue a response to it within 15 days.The rules further state that in case of a ban on content or accounts, each social media company will be required to inform all involved parties regarding the ban imposed and the underlying decision and rationale behind such bans. Officials with the Indian government have stated that social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter have repeatedly hidden behind their hierarchy being based in USA, and claimed that such a situation is inadequate for companies that have such massive presence in the country. The new IT rules were published on February 25, with an initial deadline of three months to comply with it.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.

"Just days after Reliance Jio rolled out the Jio Postpaid Plus tariff plans starting at Rs 399 per month, Bharti Airtel seems to be bringing back its own Rs 399 postpaid plan for users in select circles, in an attempt to compete. At this time, the plan is available for users via the Airtel Thanks app and is not listed on the Airtel website. This is basically the return of the Airtel Rs 399 postpaid plan that the company had unlisted a few months ago, in an attempt to drive up the average revenue per user (ARPU) with postpaid plans starting at Rs 499 instead. It is believed that the Airtel Rs 399 postpaid plan will bundle 40GB data and unlimited local as well as national calls. Late last month, Reliance Jio made wholesale changes to their postpaid tariff plans, under the Jio PostPaid Plus umbrella. The Jio PostPaid Plus tariff plans start at Rs 399 with 75GB data per month, and bundle subscriptions for streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar VIP as well as Jio TV, Jio Cinema and JioSaavn. Vi, earlier Vodafone Idea, has offered the Rs 399 postpaid plan as part of the RED umbrella for a while now. This also bundles 40GB data per month along with unlimited local and national calls.","This is basically the return of the Airtel Rs 399 postpaid plan that the company had unlisted a few months ago, in an attempt to drive up the average revenue per user (ARPU) with postpaid plans starting at Rs 499 instead.",The Airtel Rs 399 postpaid plan will bundle 40GB data and unlimited local as well as national calls.

"Apple?s Safari browser has a vulnerability that is said to be leaking users? browsing activity and even allowing bad actors to know their identity. The vulnerability affects the latest macOS, iOS, and iPadOS users. It comes due to a bug that was introduced in the implementation of IndexedDB, which works as an application programming interface (API) to store structured data. MacOS users have a workaround, where they can use a third-party web browser, but iPhone and iPad users don?t have that option. The vulnerability was first hinted in a report from 9to5Mac, which says that fraud detection firm FingerprintJS has discovered the vulnerability impacting the latest version of Safari.The vulnerability in IndexedDB, has been found in Safari 15. It follows the same origin policy that is meant to restrict documents and scripts loaded from one origin to be interacted with resources from other origins. Researchers from FingerprintJS have found that Apple?s implementation of IndexedDB violates this policy, resulting in a loophole that can be exploited by an attacker to gain access to users? activity on their web browser or identity attached to their Google account. ?Every time a website interacts with a database, a new (empty) database with the same name is created in all other active frames, tabs, and windows within the same browser session,? the researchers were quoted as saying. This vulnerability allows hackers to know what websites they are visiting in different tabs or windows. It also exposes their Google ID to websites, even if a user has not logged in using their Google account. The researchers at FingerprintJS have also released a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the vulnerability, which users can use on their Mac, iPhone, or iPad computers. It currently detects Alibaba, Instagram, Twitter, and Xbox to tell how the database can be leaked from one website to the other. For MacOS users, this vulnerability can be avoided if they switch to a third-party browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, but that option is not available for iPad and iPhone users. This is mainly because Apple does not allow iOS devices to use a third-party browser engine. Apple has not commented on the issue as of now.

"Puma has always made good looking running shoes. And Puma has always had that something different too, from time to time. Like the Puma Hybrid Astro One8, for example. Just that Puma hasn't been doing enough of this exciting stuff. But then again, we've just been through a year where everything is forgiven. The cat is back and is making its presence felt. If you are in the market for a new running shoe that is uncomplicated yet has all the modern-day goodness and tech infusions, you should certainly be considering the new Puma Deviate Nitro. These are part of the latest line of running shoes from Puma and are priced at Rs 14,999. That means these go straight into competition with the likes of the Nike React Infinity Run Flyknit 2 (around Rs 14,990) around the same price point.Something that has remained a consistent element of Puma running shoes over the years, is the lightweight design. The Puma Deviate Nitro are no different, weighing around 270 grams. The mesh upper is incredibly breathable, and the texture feels quite smooth allowing you to wear these without socks if you need to. That being said, these aren't the most generously padded on the inside, which kind of makes me feel that Puma is trying to get us a more sock-like feel for the shoe. The most apparent is the lack of padding behind the foot, where the Achilles is—this is one design element you may just have to get used to, if your older running shoe had some support there. Yet, that could just be the extra oneness with the shoe that some runners would appreciate. The shoulder and the Achilles are higher than on a lot of other shoes, and the slightly more elastic-esque fit at the top of the shoulder curves allow the foot to feel a tad more secure. Mind you, there is a generous padding on either side of the ankles and around the sides, just below the collar. The lacing eyelets are integrated in a thick plastic band on either side and the ends run quite high along the tongue, which means the fit can be very close to what you'd like. These plastic inserts aren't felt inside at all, which is great. While the Puma Deviate Nitro does narrow up a bit at the front, the toe box still gets you a lot of wriggle room and good vertical space as well for the foot to not feel hemmed in.The tech quotient really kicks in with what sits beneath your foot. First up, the battle of the midsole tech and composition that has everyone including Nike, Reebok, Asics, Adidas, Skechers and indeed Puma totally engrossed, begins the next chapter with the new Puma Nitro foam technology. The pursuit of the ideal balance between suppleness and responsiveness has gotten us this far, with the Nitro foam and the weight reduction being one of the primary reasons why the Puma Deviate Nitro is comfortably light to wear. There is that really likeable softness about this midsole as you walk around wearing the Puma Deviate Nitro, which gently hardens up as you start running and gather some pace. The result is improved responsiveness and feedback. The big reason for that is Puma's carbon fiber propulsion plate called Innoplate, that's integrated into the midsole. The thing is, there are midsole tech that use beads, for example, that compress and decompress to release energy and provide that little push for the runner which gives that assistance in the forward movement. But metal cannot really be replaced by anything else. The plate has a spoon-like shape and it looks like it is designed to scoop near the front. That is to provide a contour that goes well with your toes. While the mid onwards to the heel area delivers the bounce-back for your foot. I have to say that the changing characteristics of what's underfoot in the Puma Deviate Nitro reminds me of how car steering wheels tend to nicely weigh up as the speeds increase. That's what the Deviate Nitro also does. Walk or jog, and you'll probably just enjoy the suppleness of the Nitro midsole. Speed up, and the rigidity of the carbon fiber place starts to show its necessary intervention. There is an 8mm offset, that is the heel to toe angle—its 32mm at the heel and 24mm at the toe, for that leaning forward stance.The outsole integrated what is called the PumaGrip technology. This is, simply put, a durable rubber composition. The promise is of better grip on all types of surfaces. I haven't been able to test these in standing water or even those slightly moist and yet nastily slippery hard surfaces, but from what I have experienced on the drier underfoot scenarios, the Puma Deviate Nitro does well and there seem to be no red flags. Under the toe is the large black chunk of rubber with a mishmash of grooves and treads. Beneath your heel is the coloured dual rubber insert pair, along with the pressure release cavity—the colour of the rubber here matches with your shoe. This rubber is specifically the Puma Grip outsole, and it seems quite robust and shouldn't show any signs of wearing out even if used regularly on harder or rougher surfaces. If you look closely, you'll be able to see the carbon fiber Innoplate mid-foot. And carrying forward the point of colour matching rubber inserts, you can buy the Puma Deviate Nitro in four colorways at this time. The one photographed here is the Yellow Alert-Puma Black option, while you can also choose from Puma Black-Puma Silver, Lava Blast-Puma Black and Gray Violet-Yellow Alert variants.The Last Word: Welcome Back To The Game, Puma!The Puma Deviate Nitro at this price point is joining some serious battles to get your attention and become your running shoe choice. It won't be easy, because the rivals are quite well-stocked too, as far as the tech is concerned. Yet, the Puma Deviate Nitro is in perhaps the strongest position of any Puma running shoe so far. And the carbon fiber plate has a big role to play in that. There's a lot else going for it too, such as the lightweight design and the supple and extremely comfortable midsole that makes this quite useful as a daily use shoe when you aren't running. This is a performance running shoe and make no mistake about it, the Puma Deviate Nitro is seriously good.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.

"JioPhone users are set to get two industry leading offers, as Reliance Jio looks to cater for those who need to stay connected, but have been struggling to manage expenses as the Covid-19 pandemic takes its toll. As part of its new initiates, Reliance Jio along with the Reliance Foundation have come together to offer 300 minutes of free voice calls every month, broken down as 10 minutes of voice calls each day, for users who have not been able to recharge their JioPhone accounts during the pandemic.

"Parliament is the temple of democracy and parliamentary procedures the rites by which the will of the people is translated into practice. But the terms and jargon involved in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha processes can be difficult to grasp. The News18 series, House Talk, brings you a ready reckoner to make sure that none of it is Greek to you.As the Monsoon Session of Parliament progresses, the Centre plans to introduce a bill to replace the 155-year-old Press and Registration of Books Act with a simplified version that decriminalises various provisions and brings digital media under its ambit. The Press and Registration of Periodicals Bill, 2022, seeks to replace the Press and Registration of Books (PRB) Act, 1867, by decriminalisation of the existing Act, keeping the procedures of the extant Act simple from the view point of medium/small publishers and upholding the values of Press Freedom, a government communication to the Parliament read.The government had first released the draft Press and Registration of Periodicals Bill in 2017 that sought to ease the process of registration of newspapers and dispense with the penal provisions under the PRB Act.The PRB Act has provisions to impose a penalty on publishers for not printing the name of the printer in the newspaper or periodical or not making a declaration before the magistrate about operation of printing presses.The proposed Bill has provisions to set up a press registrar general and bring the digital media in its ambit. The 2019 draft bill had defined news on digital media as news in digitised format that can be transmitted over the internet, computer, mobile networks and includes text, audio, video and graphics.The 2022 bill is likely to consist of a larger vision of the government to bring unregulated digital platforms under a three-tier grievance redressal system. Digital media houses will be required to register themselves with the Press Registrar General, which is not a necessity at the moment.The proposed RPP Bill 2022 would enable the government to act against digital publications that are in violation and will empower the government to further impose penalties and suspend such digital publications.Not all are impressedThere was some criticism over the move which was seen as trying to control digital media which, so far, has not seen strong regulations. The Centre decided to shelve the draft Bill at that time but it has now been revived.On Monday, Day 1 of Monsoon Session, the National Alliance of Journalists (NAJ) and the Delhi Union of Journalists (DUJ) issued a joint press statement, asking MPs to ensure that 'draconian laws proposed to control the digital media are not passed'.The statement said the increasing curbs on independent journalism and wide-spectrum digital news media are 'ominous' and 'reflective of a permanent state of emergency'.Read all the Latest News and Breaking News here","The 2019 draft bill had defined news on digital media as news in digitised format that can be transmitted over the internet, computer, mobile networks and includes text, audio, video and graphics",
"'My salary was Rs 475 per month but I didn't get it for the first 8 months. Hence, I began giving tuition to students who lagged in Sanskrit and earned Rs 30 to 40which would cover my expenses. I was happy as a teacher and that's all I wanted then,' said Mattur Nandakumara. He is now chosen for the prestigious Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), an honorary title given by the United Kingdom that is on par with the Padma awards in India. King Charles III has approved his name for this year's honorary British awards given to foreign nationals.Nandakumara is identified as one of the top 100 influential Asians in the United Kingdom in his role as ambassador for India's art, culture, and philosophy. Hailing from Mattur village in Shivamogga, which is the only village in the world where Sanskrit is spoken, the language came easily to Nandakumara. He scored 124 out of 125 in the 10th class and went on to do masters in it scoring 4th rank in university.Since there was not much competition, I got a job as a Sanskrit teacher at Raghavendra high school, Malleswaram, Bengaluru. 'At times, when there was a shortage of Kannada grammar teachers, I would fill in those classes. I loved teaching and the company of kids at school,' he told News18.com. In fact, when the school had to select a Sanskrit teacher on roll and management asked students whom do they prefer, they said 'MNN' was his nickname. Therefore, he was actually chosen by the students. Nandakumara's uncle, Mattur Krishnamurthy was then a known Sanskrit scholar in London and was heading the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan there.A French lady Jenine Miller, who was studying the Vedas under him travelled to Bengaluru to learn more about the culture and traditions here. Young Nandakumara was her guide here. After a very fruitful and happy trip, she offered to host the lad if he intends to take up further studies in London anytime. This gave Nandakumara hope and desire. Almost at the same time, his uncle suggested that he did his Ph.D. in London. So, he travelled to London and completed his Ph.D.John Marr, his guide there was a big influence on him, remembers Nandakumara. He later went on to teach Sanskrit at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in London and was appointed as academic director there later. After the retirement of Mattur Krishnamurthy, Nandakumara became the head of the institution. 'I am very honored to be selected for this prestigious recognition by the UK government. But I also am very thankful for all those who trusted me and lent a helping hand to the Bhavan all these years. From George Harrison of Beatles, Priyamvada Birla to Smt Sudha Murthy of Infosys many patrons have played a very big role in shaping Bhavan,' says Nandakumara.Acknowledging his immense efforts in shaping the Bhavan, Sudha Murthy speaking to News18.com said, 'For the last 45 years, Nandakumara has created a very unique homely atmosphere for Indian art and culture in London. Varieties of art forms like classical music, Kuchipudi, Bharatanatyam, and Odissi are taught in different rooms of the Bhavan. Organising these classes and also coordinating students and teachers isn't a simple task. But Nandakumara does it wholeheartedly. He is a very humble poet and scholar. He even teaches Ramayana and Mahabharata on weekends. I have already told him that If by any chance I have to stay in London for two months, I intend to learn Raghuvamsha from him. This recognition and respect to Nandakumara are a very deserving one,' she said.Murthy sponsors 'summer school', a two-month camp in June-July for children where noted artists teach various art forms. She requests donors to come forward and contribute to their heart's content to see that several such meaningful events can be hosted in the Bhavan, London spreading India's art and culture across.Read all the Latest Education News here","Mattur Nandakumara has been chosen for the prestigious Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), an honorary title given by the United Kingdom that is on par with the Padma awards in India",
"The Congress is running its Uttar Pradesh election campaign under the leadership of national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi who has succeeded in articulating the dissatisfaction among the masses and mobilising it for electoral purposes. Through its campaign, the Congress is recreating a narrative of public discontent against the BJP government in the state and disseminating it to the public. Priyanka Gandhi has been trying to highlight the incidence of oppression and suffering of people during the second wave of Covid-19 through lectures and online campaigns.It is also trying to reach out to several social groups such as most backward communities, women, young girls, migrant labourers by creating hope and desire of empowerment. She started popular campaigns such as 'Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakati Hoon' (I am a girl, I can fight). The Congress, however, through these campaigns, helped mobilise discontent against Yogi Adityanath but may not be successful in translating it into votes. It seems that the element of discontent which Priyanka is sharpening against the BJP may be advantageous for the Samajwadi Party. It was seen in the 2012 Uttar Pradesh election campaign, when Rahul Gandhi led a popular campaign against the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) with a powerful slogan — 'Haathi Paisa Khata Hai' (The elephant is corrupt). It benefitted the Samajwadi Party in terms of electoral success. When political analysts ask why this is happening, the answer is: neither the party has any vote base nor a strong organisation to transform the 'feeling of dissatisfaction', which the party is sharpening to expand in term of votes at the booth level. It's almost true. As we know the Congress has never been a cadre-based party, it has remained a party, which has capitalised for a long time on the memories of the freedom movement, its governance and social welfare programmes and the state-led popularity and charisma of its leaders such as Jawahar Lal Nehru and Indira Gandhi and structure of vibrant regional leaders. Till the rise of the BSP, led by Kanshiram and Mayawati, Congress was a politically powerful party with strong electoral presence. The analysts are of the opinion that the BSP snatched Congress' strong Dalit base vote, which weakened the party. After the Shahbano case and the opening the lock of Ram Janmabhoomi temple, a section of Muslims deserted the Congress and slowly its Brahmin base also shifted to the BJP. The Dalits, Muslims and Brahmins were the main vote base of the Congress. The Dalits shifted to the BSP and Muslims towards SP and Brahmin opted for the BJP. That is briefly the story of the decline of the Congress.Congress's myriad followers and supporters have always worked as the cadre during the past elections, especially, till the 90s. But slowly, the nature of politics changed. Now, it is more tough and complex. To change the nature of electoral politics, the parties need trained and regular cadre with its group of supports and followers. No one can imagine doing successful politics in the age of virtual campaigns and era of big rallies without a strong cadre base and vibrant organisation. However, the Congress lacks a trained regular cadre and circle of supporters, which has shrunk over the years. That is one major loophole in Congress politics in 2022. Parties such as the BJP and SP, however, have a strong cadre base or a committed group of supporters. Thus, to translate the elements of dissatisfaction into a vote bank, the SP may appear beneficial as its committed group of supporters may turn as cadre during the election. One of my friend political analysts once opined that the political diction of the Congress lacks rural nuance.In spite of all these limitations, the Congress may improve its performance a bit in this election in terms of vote percentage and seats. But what I observe is that the Congress is working to develop its organisational infrastructures, which may help it for future politics in Uttar Pradesh. What the Congress is going to gain or lose can only be assessed after the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly election.Badri Narayan is Professor and Director at GB Pant Social Science Institute, Prayagraj, and author of 'Republic of Hindutva'.

"Kicking off the 2023 assembly poll campaign in Madhya Pradesh, the youth wing of the Madhya Pradesh Congress staged a protest in Bhopal on Thursday.Addressing the gathering at MPCC, party state head Kamal Nath said that there have been enough talks on joblessness and inflation. In order to come to power in 2023, the Congress party needs to fight the police and administration and every Congress worker should be ready for this fight, he added.'The manner in which the Shivraj government used water cannons, arrested YC workers and booked them in fake cases, exhibits the autocratic behaviour of the state government,' said Nath, commenting on the 'Yuva Shankhnaad' protest in Bhopal. 'The government has affirmed that it's not ready to listen to the youth and is eager to smother the voices seeking jobs.'Srinivas BV, the national president of the Youth Congress urged the party workers to raise rebellions against the state government at the district level. He urged YV workers to corner BJP leaders on issues including joblessness, inflation and power scarcity, whenever these leaders visit their respective areas.On issues ranging from inflation, unemployment, anomalies in entrance exams, the Vyapam scam and others, the YC workers staged a massive protest at Shivaji Nagar area where the police had put up barricades to prevent protesters from moving further. The police used water cannons as the protesters tried climbing on the barricades and both the sides pushed each other.Including former MPCC chief Arun Yadav, Sriniwas BV, Kunal Chauhdary, Vipin Vankhede and others were arrested on the occasion.Well aware of the youths' issues and the power of youth voters in the state, the Congress party has planned to launch the 2023 poll campaign while addressing youths and the Thursday protest was part of this strategy. To add, thousands of teachers who cleared recruitment tests are demanding appointments, thousands of youths are seeking the filling of vacant government posts and large numbers of youths have alleged anomalies in Vyapam (PEB) conducted exams.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.","Srinivas BV, the national president of the Youth Congress urged the party workers to raise rebellions against the state government at the district level","In order to come to power in 2023, the Congress party needs to fight the police and administration and every Congress worker should be ready for this fight, he added."
"The premier IITs have reported the highest number of student suicide cases in the last five years, the education ministry told Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. According to data from 2018 to 2023, at least 39 out of total 98 deaths by suicide in top higher education institutions of India took place at Indian Institutes of Technology, followed by 25 each at National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and centrally-funded universities. Another 13 such deaths were reported from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) from 2019 till date.Student suicide cases from 2018-2023IITs: 39NITs: 25Central universities (under University Grants Commission): 25Indian Institutes of Information Technology: 2Indian Institutes of Management: 4Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research: 3AIIMS (data only for 2019 till date): 13The data shared by minister of state Subhas Sarkar, in response to a question in the upper house of parliament, shows that 98 deaths were reported from IITs, NITs, IIMs and central universities (under UGC) among other institutes between 2018 and 2023. Of these, 39 students died by suicide in different IITs with seven taking place in the first half of this year.This year, 20 student suicide cases have already been reported across higher education institutions. The highest number of such deaths at 24 was reported in 2022. There were seven each in 2021 and 2020. In 2019, 19 student suicide cases were reported while 21 such deaths took place in 2018, as per the data.While 2020 and 2021 had institutes closed due to Covid lockdown and classes being held online, it was in 2022 that most campuses opened while some still had hybrid classes. Out of all the IITs, this year, the Madras campus has already reported five student suicide cases in six months. Director Prof V Kamakoti had, in a recent interview to News18, said the pandemic disrupting student and faculty interaction for two long years was the major reason behind a high number of students taking such an extreme step. He had also said the effects of this massive gap were felt as soon as campuses opened in 2022-23 when students returned to physical classes and had difficulty adjusting.'Academic stress, family reasons, personal reasons, mental health issues, etc, are some of the reasons for such suicide cases,' Sarkar said in his reply to parliament.On February 18, News18 had also reported that among students dying by suicide at these institutions, those from reserved categories is the highest. Over 70 percent seats in IITs are for reserved categories, which also includes quota for economically weaker sections (EWS) and minority communities.According to government data shared in parliament in 2021, a total of 122 students from centrally-funded higher education institutions — IITs, NITs, central universities, IIMs among others - died by suicide from 2014 to 2021. Of these, 58 percent students were from reserved categories (SC/ST/OBC) as well as from minority communities.Sarkar, in his response, further said the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has provisions for counselling to handle stress and emotional adjustment at these highly competitive institutions.'Further, in alignment with the NEP, to eradicate language barriers for students for an improved understanding and improved teaching-learning outcome, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has initiated the work of translating technical books into 12 scheduled regional languages,' the minister said.The education ministry has also advised the institutions to make the system more robust by including prevention, detection and remedial measures to address possible causes behind these suicides, the reply stated.The UGC released the Redressal of Grievances of Students Regulations, 2023, in April, which mandates that all higher education institutions will include one member from a marginalised caste or tribe, and one woman, in their student grievance redressal committees (SGRC). This panel is to be formed by every such institute to deal with student complaints.","Data shows at least 39 out of total 98 deaths by suicide at top higher education institutions of India took place at IITs, followed by 25 each at NITs and centrally-funded universities",

"The Allahabad High Court on Monday stayed the ASI survey of the Gyanvapi mosque till Thursday as the hearing on a plea challenging a court order on directions to conduct a scientific survey of the complex, is underway.The Supreme Court's stay on the survey as directed by a Varanasi court, ended on Wednesday. Hence, extending the stay, the court of Chief Justice Pritinker Diwaker directed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) not to carry out its survey.The Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee, which is the caretaker of the historic mosque in Varanasi, had filed a petition before the HC saying the ASI survey will damage the religious structure. The HC will continue to hear the mosque committee's petition on Thursday (July 27). 'Since the Supreme Court stay was till 5 pm today (Wednesday, July 26), if any of your team is present at the spot, ask them not to conduct the survey now as the hearing is going on,' Chief Justice Diwaker told an ASI officer.The mosque committee had approached the HC on Tuesday (July 25), challenging the district court's order last week directing the ASI to conduct a survey of the Gyanvapi mosque to unearth 'scientific facts'. The order was given on the plea of Hindu plaintiffs in the Shringar Gauri-Gyanvapi case, demanding a scientific survey of the mosque complex. But this survey was put on hold by the SC till 5 pm on July 26 to give some breathing time to the mosque committee. Besides, the top court had also observed that if the petitioner moves the HC, the registrar-judicial should ensure that the plea is placed before a bench so that it is heard before the status quo order ends.Senior advocate SFA Naqvi, the counsel representing the Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee or the Muslim side in the Gyanvapi case, said the survey ordered by the district court has been stayed by the Allahabad HC for now. The counsel further said in the affidavit filed by the ASI before the court, it has assured that the survey will be done without causing any damage to the mosque structure.'We will submit our response tomorrow,' the counsel said. But the counsel representing the five Hindu women called this a 'delay tactic' employed by the Muslim side. 'It is purely a delay tactic. The matter will now be heard on Thursday at 3.30 pm; till then, the survey will be on hold,' said Hari Shankar Jai, senior counsel representing the Hindu side. Acting promptly on the district court's order, an ASI team of some 50 people, including the five women plaintiffs, lawyers, archaeological experts among others, had launched the survey on Monday morning (July 24). But this was halted by the SC, whose order is an outcome of the hearing of a contempt petition filed by the mosque management committee challenging the district court's order.","The HC will continue hearing a petition filed by Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee, which is the caretaker of Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi, arguing that the ASI survey will damage the religious structure",

"Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday that Kerala government's bid for Thiruvananthapuram airport under PPP was 19.64 per cent lower than Adani's winning bid. The revelation by the minister came after the Kerala government opposed the handing over of Thiruvananthapuram airport under public-private partnership (PPP) to Adani Enterprises. In a statement, the minister said: ""If Kerala government is against privatisation, then why did it participate in the bidding process? The state government was given a fair chance and 'Right of First Refusal' (RoFR) if their bid was within 10 per cent below the range of the highest bid. However, they bid 19.64 per cent below. ""Then they approached the Kerala High Court which dismissed the petition in December 2019. The petitioners then filed an SLP in the Supreme Court. The apex court remitted the matter back to the Kerala High Court. There is no stay in the case either by SC or Kerala High Court."" According to the minister, the Union Cabinet has given its go-ahead for awarding the airport to the private party subject to the outcome of writ petition and in accordance with the provisions of the undertaking given by the concessionaire. ""If the petitioners succeed and the outcome of litigation leads to annulment/cancellation of bidding process, then the concessionaire will handover the possession of the airport to AAI. They will be entitled to refund of amount paid to AAI and additional investments made in the assets. ""The concessionaire will also not demand any damages from AAI. Here it should be borne in mind that these airports will come back to AAI after the lease period of 50 years,"" the statement said.

"Sex may permeate our popular culture, but conversations about it are still associated with stigma and shame in Indian households. As a result, most individuals dealing with sexual health issues or trying to find information about sex often resort to unverified online sources or follow the unscientific advice of their friends.To address the widespread misinformation about sex, News18.com is running this weekly sex column, titled 'Let's Talk Sex'.

Monkeypox virus is part of the same family of viruses as variola virus, the virus that causes smallpox. It causes flu-like symptoms such as fever and chills, and a rash that can take weeks to clear. There's no proven treatment for monkeypox, but it usually goes away on its own.Over the last few weeks, there have been reports of an atypical outbreak of monkeypox in different regions of the world where the disease is not usually found. The most likely route of transmission in the current outbreak appears to be close skin-to-skin contact and close respiratory contact during sexual activities. The virus has been reported to be present in semen, but the role of semen in transmission has not been demonstrated yet. Body fluids, including respiratory tract droplets, allow monkeypox to be spread during sexual activity.What is monkeypox and how is it spread?Monkeypox is a rare viral disease which may look like pimples or blisters, sometimes with a flu-like illness. It was discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in groups of monkeys being used for research. It does not normally spread easily between people as it requires very close physical contact to allow the virus to enter the body. It can spread to anyone through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact including:Contact with respiratory secretions.Oral, anal, and vaginal sex or touching the genitals (penis, testicles, labia, and vagina) or anus of a person with monkeypox.Hugging, massage, and kissing.Direct contact with monkeypox rash, scabs, or body fluids from a person with monkeypox.Prolonged face-to-face contact.Touching fabrics and objects during sex that were used by a person with monkeypox and that have not been disinfected, such as bedding, towels, and sex toys.Having multiple or anonymous sex partners may increase your chances for exposure to monkeypox. Limiting your number of sex partners may reduce the possibility of exposure.Researchers are still trying to better understand if virus could be present in semen, vaginal fluids, or other body fluids.What are the symptoms?Someone who has contracted monkeypox usually starts to show symptoms from around 6-13 days after contact with an infected, symptomatic person, or their belongings, but it can take up to 21 days. The most common symptom is an evolving rash that develops from vesicles into blisters. This also includes:Flu-like symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle aches and backache, sore throat, cough, swollen lymph nodes, chills, or exhaustion.If someone has flu-like symptoms, they will usually develop a rash 1-4 days later.The rash may be located on or near the genitals or anus but could also be on other areas like the hands, feet, chest, or face.The rash will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing.The rash can look like pimples or blisters and may be painful or itchy.The rash may also be inside the body, including the mouth, vagina, or anus.Monkeypox can be spread from the time symptoms start until the rash has healed, all scabs have fallen off, and a fresh layer of skin has formed. This can take several weeks.How can you prevent Monkeypox Virus?The best way to prevent this virus is to decrease human contact with infected animals and limit person-to-person spread. This includes:Avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with people who have a rash that looks like monkeypox.Do not touch the rash or scabs of a person with monkeypox.Do not kiss, hug, cuddle or have sex with someone with monkeypox.Do not share eating utensils or cups with a person with monkeypox.Do not handle or touch the bedding, towels, or clothing of a person with monkeypox.Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.Wear a mask that covers your mouth and nose when around others.Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.Use personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for people infected with the virus.Avoid contact with infected animals (especially sick or dead animals).While so far, most cases have appeared in men who have sex with men, health officials have cautioned that this isn't a disease that's isolated to any one community. There are no treatments specifically for monkeypox virus infections. However, monkeypox and smallpox viruses are genetically similar, which means that antiviral drugs and vaccines developed to protect against smallpox may be used to prevent and treat monkeypox virus infections.If you have symptoms of monkeypox, you should talk to your healthcare provider, even if you don't think you have had contact with someone who has monkeypox.Read all the Latest News and Breaking News here","While so far, most Monkeypox cases have appeared in men who have sex with men, health officials have cautioned that this isn't a disease that's isolated to any one community",
"As India gears up for mass inoculation against Covid-19 and cases of Coronavirus infection continue to see a steady trend of decline, flight services from the United Kingdom to India resumed on Friday after restrictions imposed in the wake of the new variant of Coronavirus were lifted.On December 14, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland reported a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 to the World Health Organization. Called B117, the variant spreads more rapidly even though initial studies show that it is not associated with severity of the Covid-19 disease. Studies are also underway in India and abroad to study whether the mutated train will hamper efficacy of vaccines against the novel Coronavirus.India had initially banned all flights originating from the United Kingdom to India from December 22 to December 31. This ban was extended up to January 7. In the meantime, the government began genomic surveillance of samples collected from UK returnees to check for the UK variant of the virus. As on Friday, 82 people were found to be infected with the new strain of the novel Coronavirus, the Union health ministry said.Move ahead with caution and continuous surveillancePublic health experts and government scientists said that the resumption of flight services has to be accompanied with caution and a continuous and close surveillance of those who have returned from the UK.Manoj Murhekar, Director, National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, said that even as genomic surveillance of UK returnees is underway, it is quite likely that the strain has been circulation since it was first detected in September. Murhekar said that the government's detailed genomic surveillance exercise will reveal whether it has indeed been in circulation prior to November-December period.Murhekar was referring to the genomic surveillance exercise that has been underway since April at National Institute of Virology, Pune; Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi; National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG), Kalyani, West Bengal and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad. In the last of December, the government also formed a consortium of autonomous scientific institutions to study the evolution of the virus, to expand genomic surveillance and co-related it to the trends in transmission of the infection.By December end, over 4,500 samples collected from various parts of the country were sequenced to check for different strains.'We are not seeing any increase in the number of cases nationally, we have seen decline from a high of 90,000 plus per day. Data from England has shown it is not associated with more severity. It is more transmissible but not more severe. I don't think we will see a major upsurge, based on the trends we are witnessing,' Murhekar said.According to the WHO, retrospective analysis traced the first identified variant to Kent, South East England, on 20 September 2020, which was followed by a rapid increase of the same variant identified later in November.D.C.S Reddy, former professor and head of community medicine, IMS-Benaras Hindu University and member of a government expert group on Covid-19 surveillance, said that health authorities need to follow the same protocol and principles followed back in March 2020 - test, track, treat.'The UK variant has changes in spike protein and is feared to spread rapidly. In England, this variant was predominant in clusters with rapid spread. In India, the epidemic is on the decline and this variant seems to have potential to affect that scenario,' said Reddy.He added, 'However, this can be prevented with the standard protocol of test, track, treat. Those arriving from the UK need to be screened and tested, isolated if positive, and their contacts ought to be traced. Further, even those who test negative should be quarantined at home. There is a possibility that they might have picked up the infection just hours or days prior to their arrival. They still have the potential to transmit the infection.'Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here","According to the WHO, retrospective analysis traced the first identified variant to Kent, South East England, on 20 September 2020, which was followed by a rapid increase of the same variant identified later in November.",
"Among India's most serious yet marginally addressed development challenges is malnutrition, which contributes significantly to the country's disease burden. Despite programme commitments since 1975, such as creating Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and national coverage of the mid-day meal scheme, India continues to grapple with a high rate of undernutrition. Improving nutrition and managing stunting continue to be big challenges, and they can be addressed only with an inter-sectoral strategy.Stunting has lifelong consequences on human capital, poverty and equity. It leads to less potential in education and fewer professional opportunities. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5, India has unacceptably high levels of stunting, despite marginal improvement over the years. In 2019-21, 35.5 per cent of children below five years were stunted and 32.1 per cent were underweight. India ranks 116 out of 174 countries on the human capital index. Lack of investment in health and education leads to slower economic growth. The World Bank says, 'A 1 per cent loss in adult height due to childhood stunting is associated with a 1.4 per cent loss in economic productivity.' Stunting also has lasting effects on future generations. Further, with 57 per cent of women anaemic in 2019-21, this will have lasting effects on their future pregnancies and children. The situation worsens when infants are fed inadequate diets.Ambitious GoalsThe Poshan Abhiyaan 2018 aimed to achieve a malnutrition-free India by 2022. The plan is to reduce stunting prevalence in children (0-3 years) by about three percentage points per year by 2022 from NFHS-4 levels, and achieve a one-third reduction in anaemia in children, adolescents and women of reproductive age.This is an ambitious goal, especially given that the decline in stunting from 48 per cent in 2006 to 35.5 per cent in 2019-21 comes to only one percentage point a year. This promise calls for serious alignment among ministries, convergence of nutrition programmes, and stringent monitoring of the progress made in achieving these goals.The data available on stunting tell us where to concentrate future programmes. Stunting prevalence tends to increase with age and peaks at 18-23 months. Timely nutritional interventions of breastfeeding, age-appropriate complementary feeding, full immunisation, and Vitamin A supplementation have proven effective in improving outcomes in children. However, NHFS data shows that only 41.8 per cent children are breastfed within one hour of birth, 63.7 per cent are exclusively breastfed for six months, 45.9 per cent are provided timely complementary foods, and only 11.3 per cent children below two years receive an adequate diet. The data confirms that the complementary feeding practices being followed are poor and need urgent attention. It is well recognised that most of the growth faltering occurs during this critical period, from six months to two years, when complementary feeding plays a significant role in addressing nutrition intake by a child. It is evident that adoption of appropriate complementary feeding practices requires behavioural changes with reference to making informed selection of appropriate food items and following recommended feeding practices. Vitamin A deficiency can increase infections like measles and diarrhoeal diseases. About 30 per cent of children don't get full immunisation and Vitamin A supplementation. They must be provided these for disease prevention.Variations across States and DistrictsAccording to NFHS-5 data, India has more stunted children in rural areas (37.3 per cent) as compared to urban centres (30.1 per cent), possibly due to the low socio-economic status of households in rural areas. The inter-generational cycle of malnutrition has to be tackled with effective interventions for both mother (pre- and post-pregnancy) and child, to address the high burden of stunting.In terms of geographical regions, Meghalaya (46.5 per cent), Bihar (42.9 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (39.7 per cent) and Jharkhand (39.6 per cent) have very high rates of stunting, while states/UT with the lowest rates include Sikkim and Puducherry at 22.3 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. A comparison of NFHS-4 with NFHS-5 findings shows that few states (Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand) have reported decline in stunting by at least 6 percentage points, Rajasthan has recorded a decline by 7.3 per cent. While nutrition has improved across all states, inter-state variabilities remain high. The two states that had the lowest stunting rates in children in 2015-16 (NFHS-4) but showed a substantial rise in stunting rate as per the NFHS-5 survey are Goa (from 20.1 per cent to 25.8 per cent) and Kerala (from 19.7 per cent to 23.4 per cent).Looking at this data, it is imperative to push for convergence of health and nutrition programmes right from pregnancy until the child reaches five years of age. A well-planned and effective social behavioural and communication (SBCC) strategy is essential since behaviours are ingrained in society and in family traditions. What is really needed is effective monitoring and implementation of programmes to address malnutrition and prioritising the reduction of child undernutrition in the national development agenda.Dr Shoba Suri is a Senior Fellow with ORF's Health Initiative.

"Politics is ingrained in Indian society. Be it caste, language or gender, every group aspires political representation and a stake in political power. Political Matrix will focus on these groups and their aspirations in each state of India and decode their electoral choices.Elections in India provide an opportunity to the marginalised communities to project their aspirations and contribute to the vibrancy of the Indian democracy. These aspirations are shaped by the level of political awareness and mobilisation among these communities. As we know, numbers matter a lot in democracy: numbers give subaltern social groups the capacity to aspire and acquire political influence and hissedari (share) in resources, development and power.Few months ago, we saw elections in five states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur. Come winter, and Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh will go to polls. My previous article in Political Matrix had focused on the aspirations of Patidars, a powerful community in Gujarat that every political party wants to woo. In this article, I will train my lens on Dalits, a marginalised social community in Gujarat, and what may dictate their political choices.How the Numbers Stack UpIn Gujarat, the population of Scheduled Castes is estimated at 7 per cent - this includes around 36 castes and social groups. Like in other parts of India, Scheduled Castes or SCs in Gujarat too have not yet evolved as a politically powerful bloc; they are still disparate and heterogeneous social groups. At a social level, they are suffering all kinds of exclusions but even within the SC population, one may find graded inequalities, identified by Babasaheb Ambedkar as an inherent nature of Indian social system. In the process of democratisation and development, a sense of competition and jealousy has developed among the castes and subcastes of SCs and Dalits. This, at times, may create hindrance in their political consolidation as a big social group.In Gujarat, Vankar, Valmiki, Khalpa (Chambhar), Meghwal are comparatively bigger communities among SCs. In spite of their impressive numbers, the process of their politicisation is slow, and their representation in politics is yet to become visible. However, government benefits, development programmes, reservation in education and jobs are reaching to them, albeit slowly. This will subsequently help them develop the capacity to aspire, politically. The Evolving Dalit PoliticsThe Congress' regime in Gujarat saw a few political leaders from these marginalised communities emerge on the scene, largely because they traced their roots to the Indian freedom movement. But over time, in the politics of the Congress, these leaders due to various reasons lost prominence. Many Dalit leaders groomed during the Congress' time have now shifted to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been in power in the state for nearly 27 years.Although the BJP has developed a strong leadership in the state over the years, it is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which started working among these communities after Independence. In the last three-four decades, the organisation's efforts have engineered a shift in the political profile of these marginalised communities. On the foundation of Hindutva, the BJP government's welfarism has further brought these communities closer to the party. Yet, social contradictions have challenged the BJP's expansion mission among marginalised communities. The flogging of Dalits in Una in 2016 and the political mobilisation around it is one such example. Also, incidents like these led to young voices from the community, like Jignesh Mewani, evolve as leaders.On the other hand, the BJP too has evolved leaders like Ramanlal Vora, Kirit Parmar among others as the Dalit face of its politics.The Dalits in Gujarat are evolving their politics mostly through local self-governance, by being elected to panchayats, zila panchayats and municipal corporations. Some of them may emerge as future leaders in the evolving Dalit politics in the state. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), a relatively new entrant in Gujarat politics, is also trying to woo Dalits by giving them positions in the party and tickets in local elections. We have to see which of these competing political parties is able to successfully embrace a larger section of the SC community and vice-versa.The party which is most sensitive to their aspirations for inclusion, dignity and political share and responds to them in a practical and pragmatic way will be able to mobilise a larger section of this historically disadvantaged community in their favour, in 2022 elections.You can read all the articles in the Political Matrix series here.Badri Narayan is Professor and Director at GB Pant Social Science Institute, Prayagraj, and author of 'Republic of Hindutva'.

"Tata Sky is reportedly exploring ways to help its customers reduce cost of TV subscriptions, thereby retaining its subscribers to the DTH network. According to a report by NDTV, Tata Sky is set to revise subscription packs basis customer behaviour data that it has observed on its app or website for the past month. As per the data, over 70 percent of the 5 million-odd Tata Sky DTH subscribers logged on to the website to either cancel their subscriptions or reduce monthly costs, as the Covid-19 pandemic impacted both salaried and self-employed individuals alike. In a bid to reduce the drastic fall of subscribers on its DTH network, Tata Sky is reportedly looking to 'rationalise' monthly costs for users with billing of Rs 350 or lesser. This rationalisation process will be undertaken by using Tata Sky's internal analytics engine to identify the said users, and then use the data to optimise the packs or channels selected, in a bid to reduce the overall monthly expenses and encourage users to not cancel their subscriptions right away. As a result, many users may soon be contacted and offered cheaper alternate plans by Tata Sky itself. According to reports, Tata Sky will give a prior notice of 15 days before reducing the cost of the subscription packs. Reports by various publications indicate that Tata Sky may have already lost over 1.5 million subscribers during the Covid-19 pandemic period that began in March. In a bid to ebb the outflow of subscribers, Tata Sky's new strategy to optimise the plans may reduce monthly costs by up to Rs 100. However, it remains unclear right now if such a strategy would ultimately help the DTH operator retain its user base. Even apart from the pandemic, users have been reportedly unsubscribing from DTH networks, as adoption of OTT platforms and online content viewing continue to rise. It now remains to be seen if a similar trend is being observed by other operators such as Airtel DTH, Dish TV and others as well. Tata Sky has been attempting to target a crossover of users as well by offering Android TV boxes, in a bid to combine the benefits of both DTH channels and OTT content.",Reports state that over 70 percent of Tata Sky's 5 million-odd subscribers either cancelled or reduced their monthly TV billings in May.,"In a bid to reduce the drastic fall of subscribers on its DTH network, Tata Sky is reportedly looking to 'rationalise' monthly costs for users with billing of Rs 350 or lesser."

"All those amongst us who have been waiting for to see what the upcoming OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro would be like, and hopefully splurge some money on them, might want to reconsider how much they have already saved up. And start saving some more, because these are apparently going to be expensive. That is, if the prices that have apparently been leaked by a European retailer Alza.sk, based in Slovakia. Needless to say, those listings have since been removed from the shopping platform, but that quick glimpse at the accompanying price tags has been enough to start a conversation. The OnePlus 8 and the OnePlus 8 Pro are expected to be officially announced sometime this month. The good folks over at WinFuture.de had a glimpse of the price tags before the product listings disappeared from the website. So, here is how things stand at the moment, based on the data from those listings. There will be two variants each of the OnePlus 8 and the OnePlus 8 Pro with prices starting at €719. That is, starting at Rs 59,380 if the direct conversion method is deployed—local taxes, shipping costs and overheads are yet to be factored in. This is how the supposed individual variant pricing of the OnePlus 8 models looks like. The OnePlus 8 is expected to be available in Interstellar Glow, Onyx Black and Glacial Green colour options. The second, and higher price tag for each variant could be for a different colour option that will cost that little bit more. • OnePlus 8 w/ 8GB RAM, 128GB storage: €719/729 • OnePlus 8 w/ 12GB RAM, 256GB storage: €819/829 Direct currency conversions from Euro to Indian Rupee indicates that prices for the OnePlus 8 would start at around Rs 59,380 for the base variant and upwards of Rs 67,678 for the higher spec option. Incidentally, the €719 price is around €200 more than the OnePlus 7, the phone that it succeeds. If you had been eyeing a OnePlus 8 Pro, this is apparently how much it will cost you. You will be able to buy these in Ultramarine Blue, Onyx Black and Glacial Green colour options. • OnePlus 8 Pro w/ 8GB RAM, 128GB storage: €919/929 • OnePlus 8 Pro w/ 12GB RAM, 256GB storage: €1,009/1019 A simple conversion method here indicates that the OnePlus 8 Pro will cost upwards of Rs 75,945 for the entry spec option while the higher variants will be priced starting Rs 83,383. We must however accept these price tags with a generous dose of scepticism, as would be prudent till the company officially announces the prices of the OnePlus 8 and the OnePlus 8 Pro. But this, if it is true, could indicate OnePlus is adamant on firmly positioning its new phones as proper Android flagship phones, and abandons the flagship-killer and affordable-flagship positioning. At this time, One Plus sells the OnePlus 7 with price tags of Rs 29,999 and Rs 34,999 while The OnePlus 7 Pro is priced at Rs 48,999. The newer OnePlus 7T costs Rs 34,999 and Rs 37,999 depending on the variant you pick while the OnePlus 7T Pro costs Rs 53,999 and the McLaren Special Edition sets you back by Rs 58,999.","There will be two variants each of the OnePlus 8 and the OnePlus 8 Pro with prices starting at €719.

"For most people, relaxing in a 5-star hotel is among the top points on their bucket lists. But the expenses are a hurdle some cannot overcome. What if we told you that there was a way you could cross this dream off your bucket list, and that too with minimal expenses? Through loyalty programmes and credit card rewards, you may be able to enjoy a short stay at a 5-star hotel with little to no charges.Let's take a look at how loyalty programmes work:If you are enrolled in the loyalty programme of a hotel chain like the Hyatt or the Marriott, you will earn reward points any time you book a room for business travel. These points start in the range of 1 to 4 percent per Rs 100, as reported by Mint, and can go up to 8 percent depending on the membership tier you are on.As you progress through the membership tiers, you will get perks like discounts on hotel bookings, spa vouchers, late check-out facility and access to executive lounges.But these programmes only work if you book frequent stays in the same chain, which is not possible for most people.A more preferred option is credit card rewards. You can use your credit card for transactions like paying your bills, tuition fees, shopping and more.The points will slowly accumulate in your credit card account. As most banks have partnerships with 5-star hotel chains, you might be able to transfer your points to stay in these luxurious retreats. If you use your credit card frequently, you may be able to transfer the reward points to pay for your flight tickets as well.A word of caution to everyone who is planning to use this scheme- Make sure your credit card bills are paid on time. Lapses in your credit card payments can lead to debt. It can also lower your credit score, reducing your chances of getting loans at a more favourable interest rate.Another thing to keep in mind before embarking on a credit card reward programme is to make sure that the bank has an alliance with the hotel chain you want to stay in.By keeping these factors in mind, you could get a big discount on 5-star hotel bookings and enjoy a stay in the lap of luxury.","As most banks have partnerships with 5-star hotel chains, you might be able to transfer your points to stay in these luxurious retreats.","Through loyalty programmes and credit card rewards, you may be able to enjoy a short stay at a 5-star hotel with little to no charges."

But the questions are ringing in louder this year, now that the Phone 2 gets a starting price of Rs 44,999 going up to Rs 54,999 for the top 512GB variant. So can Nothing Phone 2 become the first choice for buyers in a market where the options are plenty? Our review here gives you the details after using the phone for over a few weeks. Nothing Phone 2 Review: What's Cool?Nothing has definitely nailed it with the design, fit and finish of the Phone 2. If you felt the Phone 1 had a premium approach, the Phone 2 goes a step further. The curved layout at the back gives it a solid grip. The recycled aluminium frame adds to its durability. All the focus is on the design of the phone once againBut talking about a Nothing phone is incomplete without taking a closer look at the back panel. Yes, it is still transparent but the Glyph LEDs have been tweaked to make it feature rich and likely to get further additions in the near future. The front and back glass panel gets Corning Gorilla Glass protection which should give you some peace of mind while keeping the phone on its backside. It has a 6.7-inch OLED display which not gets an LTPO panel with 120Hz refresh rateNothing has upgraded the OLED display which now gets an LTPO panel which offers adaptive refresh rate between 1Hz to 120Hz based on what you are doing on the phone. The screen is crisp and the colours are punchy, which is helpful when you consume a lot of textual content on the phone. And even though it supports Full HD+ resolution, you won't find it lacking in any way. The bezels on the screen are symmetrical which adds further appeal to the front of the phone and the punch hole cutout it at the top-centre this time around. The phone is powered by Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset with up to 12GB RAMThe company has bumped the performance levels of its second phone, moving from a mid range-ish to a flagship-level hardware. Using the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip with up to 12GB RAM delivers an excellent boost in its overall usability. You get the Nothing OS 2.0 version and promise of three more OS updatesAdding further richness to the experience is the Nothing OS 2.0 version which has to be one of the best UI we have come across outside of Google's Pixel UI. In fact, the Nothing software has elements that were the hallmark of the OxygenOS from OnePlus during Carl's stint at the company. The interface is fluid, aided by the high refresh rate screen and a powerful hardware. But there is a lot more that works seamlessly for the UI, for instance, the apps open without any lag, we didn't notice major issues while multitasking and running videos for hours without any hiccups. The dual rear cameras are 50MP IMX890 sensor with OIS and 50MP ultrawide-angle sensorThe primary camera on the Phone 2 is a 50MP Sony IMX890 sensor which is the same you get on the OnePlus 11 5G and a few other phones in this range. This camera offers crisp, detailed and colour-rich photos in bright conditions. We barely noticed any lag in the shutter speed and the processing part of the Nothing OS 2.0 polishes the image further, something people might like. The phone packs a 4700mAh battery this time, with support for 45W wired charging speedAnd finally, it is time to talk about one of the more important features on a smartphone, its battery life. The Phone 2 has a 4700mAh battery which is 200mAh more than what you had on the Phone 1 and might not sound like a big upgrade. But when you start putting the Phone 2 through the daily grind, you realise the optimisations done under the hood, and using this chip has paid rich dividends. Phone 2 was easily lasting us over a day and half in moderate usage, which means for most people it would last through a day and more. In terms of the metrics, the Phone 2 gave us 8 hours+ screen-on-time on an average over 10 days which is quite decent for the battery size the phone offers. You also have wireless charging like the Phone 1, and reverse wireless charging, in case your wireless earbuds are running low on juice. Nothing Phone 2 Review: What's Not So Cool?While the Glyph interface has its attraction, we still feel it is a work in progress. Nothing is relying on people keeping the phone on the backside to make the LEDs work effectively or offer any value. You have the Uber ride progress chart through the timer which is a new addition, you have the jazzy ringtones but the novelty value of this feature tends to wear out after a few days. The design is definitely catchy but the glass panel, especially the grey variant tends to be a fingerprint magnet and definitely slippery when you face it towards the screen. The glass panel has its consThe phone's main camera feels a bit underpowered with low light shots. However, Nothing has shown us that a few updates can fix those chinks, and we expect the same in the coming months. The ultrawide shooter clicks photos but the details can be inconsistent which negates its purpose for most users. The phone's battery life is a big plus but you only get 45W wired charging speed out of the box. Add to that, Nothing doesn't give you the charger in the box, which means you have to add another 2 grand to your overall budget when buying the Phone 2. We expected the brand to boost the speed, now that the rivals in this range offer as high as 100W charging speed. Nothing Phone 2 Review: Should You Buy It?The Phone 2 is an upgrade and there is no doubt about that. But it is not for anybody using the Phone 1. If you have a phone that is 2-3 years old by now, the Phone 2 makes sense. But here's the catch, for Rs 44,999 you only get the 8GB RAM variant of the Phone 2. So the best value Phone 2 option comes for Rs 49,999 which makes it expensive in a lot of ways. Make no mistake, the design is premium, the hardware boost is undeniable and the software is one of the best in the market. But Nothing is trying to dine in the premium table and for that, it needs more than just a premium design, especially when the competition is offering something better. So, if you are happy spending on a phone with the LEDs, crisp display, reliable performance, and solid battery life, Phone 2 is a definite choice, but you also have the iQOO Neo 7 Pro with the same chip but faster charging at a lower price or the OnePlus 11R with similar features and also at lower price tag than the Phone 2 in the market.","The second-gen Nothing Phone comes with a lot of promise, polish and premiumness but is it worth the increased price tag?",

"I have often remarked how impressed I was with the Samsung Galaxy Buds when I got to experience them last year. Clearly, Samsung had made an early jump, compared to a lot of its rivals, into the wireless earbuds space and done it well enough. It had the sound, it had the battery stamina, they were light and well, they just worked. At least if you were using them with an Android device. Which means hopes were high when the new Samsung Galaxy Buds+ landed on my desk. Do they still offer the sort of value that would have people lining up to buy these, even as there is now significant competition around? In a nutshell, they are even better than before. The competition check for the Samsung Galaxy Buds+, which is priced at Rs 11,990 takes up to the Jabra Elite 75t (priced around Rs 14,999), the slightly older yet still excellent Jabra Elite 65t (priced around Rs 11,999) and of course the Apple AirPods (around Rs 14,000). Most certainly, this matches its very competent rivals spec for spec and in turns the overall experience as well. Whether it is a bundled and discounted deal with a new Samsung smartphone, or you are splurging the full ticket price, the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are definitely worth considering for anyone in the wireless earbuds space. Design: More of the same is not a bad thing The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ look more or less like its predecessors, the Samsung Galaxy Buds. That is not a bad thing, because it means the compact size of the earbuds and the charging case is retained. Great then. In terms of volume, it seems quite similar to the case of the Jabra Elite 75t, but the design makes it seem a bit more compact. That has a positive impact on the overall weight as well—the case weighs just 39.6 grams. Each earbud weighs just 6.3 grams. In fact, the charging case supports wireless charging as well—you simply drop this on a Qi standard wireless charger, and it'll juice up the battery in the case as well as the earbuds. In fact, if you have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging—such as the Samsung Galaxy S20 series and the OnePlus 8 Pro, for instance—you can simply plonk this on the back of the phone for the desired charging effect. Quite convenient then, when you travel. Right now, you can buy the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ in black, white and blue colour options. What I have for review is the black variant, which gets a glossy finish on the case. Keep it clean, and it looks gorgeous. Be rough with it, and it'll catch scratches. Totally your call. I quite like earbuds that sit flat in the charging case. It is just easier to pull these out of the case when you need to, particularly when you may be out and about. Anything that reduces the risk of the earbuds slipping out of your fingers and tumbling earthwards, is most welcome. The thing with the Samsung Galaxy Buds and now the Galaxy Buds+ is that they are incredibly comfortable to wear. The buds very light and rest easily in the ear. With the medium eartip attachments, they sit snugly in the ear, and remain secure. So much so, I don't need to deploy the silicon hooks to keep these in place. Comfort is great even if you wear these for a few hours at a stretch. That being said, you may notice the seal they create when sitting snugly and with no vent in place like the AirPods Pro, you might feel to urge to let your ears breathe every few hours. There seems to be one troubling compromise though. While a lot of earbuds come with the slightly more secure IPX4 water and dust resistance, Samsung has given the Galaxy Buds+ the IPX2 protection. Getting caught in a sharp shower could be a bit of a headache. Sound: It is all about neutral foundations and letting you choose The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ get a dual driver design, which means a dedicated tweeter and woofer in each ear. Remember, even more expensive earbuds often don't have dual drivers working in each earbud, and that in itself is a great foundation to build on. This audio hardware immediately offers the sort of music listening experience which a lot of other earbuds will struggle to match because of the now clear hardware limitations at their end. In my experience, the Galaxy Buds+ deliver pretty wide sound with a whole lot of detailing and well distinguished elements. The sound signature is decidedly neutral, which is a good foundation to build on from. There doesn't seem to be any artificial boosting of either end of the audio spectrum. The Galaxy Buds+ are tuned by AKG, an audio brand that has roots in Austria and is owned by Samsung. In fact, you would have probably noticed the AKG branding on many Samsung smartphone packages and the earphones that are bundled with the phones. As for the soundstage, what the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ deliver is extremely good. But having also heard the Jabra Elite 75t, those tend to have a bit more sparkle with the same music. But like I said, if you hear the Galaxy Buds+, you wouldn't say anything is missing. Out of the box, in the neutral setting, the Galaxy Buds+ still serve up a generous amount of bass. For most users, that would be adequate for a variety of content and usage scenarios. Head to the Galaxy Buds+ companion app (free for Android and iOS) and you get a choice of Bass Boost, Soft, Dynamic, Clear and Treble Boost EQ options as a rather intuitive dial. The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ have a rather neat trump card up their sleeve—noise isolation. This isn't active noise cancellation, but what this does with the help of two outer mics and one inner mic in each year is to subdue the background noises and disturbances so that your music sounds clean and your voice goes through on calls without any ruckus latching on. It does a fairly good job of blocking out considerable amount of noise around you, and a lot of that also has to do with the snug fit that the buds adopt in your ears. It would be wrong to compare this with the likes of the Apple AirPods Pro or the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds which have significantly more advanced noise cancellation, but also cost a lot more while at it. You can tweak the isolation settings in the Galaxy Buds+ app as well. Battery: Last long. Really long The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ really march ahead of the rivals when it comes to battery life. The buds last around 11 hours on a single charge—that's with an 85mAh battery in each earbud. Add the charging boost from the carry case, which has a 270mAh battery, and you get that to 22 hours. If you are running low on charge and have to step out immediately, a three-minute splash and dash with the USB-C port gives you an hour of listening time. The companion app is also very handy with giving you the status of the battery in each earbud and the charging case. Controls: No complications The simplicity of the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ touch controls comes as a relief, when a lot of earbuds tend to go a bit overboard with all the combinations and whatnot. You tap on the outer portion of the earbud to pause or play music, for instance. You can choose the response to the long-press—invoke the virtual assistant, alter the ambient sound mode and so on. The Last Word: Everything Comes Together Perfectly The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ look a lot like their predecessor, the Galaxy Buds. But do not let that fool you, because the Galaxy Buds+ are all grown up. Balanced sound, compact footprint, superb battery life and a companion app that is actually useful—all things that come together to make the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ a must have if you are looking for good earbuds in this price range. It works equally well for Android, iOS and Windows users, which simply adds to the versatility. The only shortcoming is the lack of true water resistance, but if you are a bit careful with these in the rainy season, it really shouldn't be a deal-breaker.",Not every wireless earbud launch had to be AirPods-killers or whatever. Revolutionary thought—each can have its own identity. The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are doing exactly that with a solid mix of performance and personality.,
"The Quad foreign ministers' meeting in Melbourne on Friday had interesting timing. China has been bruised by diplomatic boycotts of its Beijing Winter Olympics and tensions between the United States and Russia on Ukraine are peaking, to say the least, in a telling show of US President Joe Biden's priorities in foreign policy. Fears of the Quad losing its focus on China have been running rife since Donald Trump stepped out of the White House. And indeed, the Quad is not the same without Mike Pompeo, former US secretary of state and an articulate China-hawk. These concerns worried all other Quad partners in their own way. For Japan, Australia and India, China remains the biggest threat and yet a dilution of the Quad's core Indo-Pacific agenda has been underway. In such a challenging situation, India's diplomatic heft has proved its mettle.The Quad joint statement came with an unequivocal slap on the wrist for China. It held up the importance of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), mentioned challenges to the maritime rules-based order in both the South and East China Seas— waters threatened by China, and vowed to protect regional partners and their ability to develop offshore resources in their waters as per international law, and resist illegal, unregulated fishing— something China's fishing militias would not like to hear. There was a categorical condemnation of North Korea and its reckless ballistic missile launches as well. Also Read: 'Ready To Supply Covovax, Corbevax Covid-19 Vaccines': India Tells Quad PartnersBut the path to consensus among the four players was rockier on the Russia-Ukraine issue and Myanmar. India, however, steered clear of saying anything on Ukraine or Russia, even as Australia and Japan made varying statements on the matter in solidarity with the United States. A statement from India's Minister of External Affairs Dr S Jaishankar on 'Russia's actions in Ukraine' could not be extracted as he declined to answer in no uncertain terms, saying, 'This meeting is focused on the Indo-Pacific, so I'm sure you understand geography. And where we stand, our position on Ukraine, we have laid it out in public at the U.N. Security Council.' Obviously, India does not wish to tread down the path of taking sides between the United States and Russia, being the only Quad member with relatively mature ties with Russia. On January 31st, India abstained from a US-backed UNSC vote on the Ukraine-Russia issue and was appreciated by Moscow for it. So, Russia and Ukraine could not make the cut in the Quad's statement solely on account of India's reservations, and Jaishankar's eloquent circumvention of the matter.On Myanmar too, India stood resolutely firm against 'national sanctions'. As an immediate neighbour of the Southeast Asian nation, now crippled under the Military Junta regime, India is aware of the recoil effect of sanctions. More specifically, sanctions would only pave the way for China's tentacles to creep into Myanmar and the lesson from Sri Lanka advises strictly against that. But India did find more than just takers of its own concerns about Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. The joint Quad statement addressed arguably each one of India's concerns on terrorism in relatively greater detail. It denounced the use of 'terrorist proxies for cross-border terrorism', urged for the elimination of 'terrorist safe havens' and the disruption of financial channels which sustain terrorists. The statement condemned explicitly the 'terror attacks in India' naming the 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks. With this, India has seemingly managed to underscore Pakistan as the second biggest threat, after China, when it comes to the Quad's focus. A significant victory. Moving forward, hours after the meeting, the United States did find time from its busy Ukraine-focused schedule, to launch its Indo-Pacific strategy where it highlights India as the Indo-Pacific's key element and vows to support a 'leading India' and its 'continued rise and regional leadership.' All in all, India's position in the Quad remains strong, and consequently, the Quad too shall go the distance and register more material successes on the way.

"For mobile users, a companion app that lets them manage their prepaid or postpaid connection is now par for the course. Every mobile service provider has one. You can see the billing details or prepaid validity details, make bill payments and recharge and even make payments for friends and family who may also be using a prepaid or postpaid connection from the same service provider. In fact, you can also manage other services by the same company, if they offer home broadband or DTH TV services as well, for instance. However, not everyone does it as well as Reliance Jio, and the MyJio app for Jio prepaid and postpaid users, JioFiber subscribers as well as JioFi and JioLink users. Is MyJio a super app, perhaps? With the sort of wide options, mini apps and functionality that are available in one app, it can most certainly be classified as one. And speaking of super apps, the Chinese owned app WeChat is in trouble in the US. It is often classified as a super app, at least in China, for the variety of options it offers, including messaging and payments. US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order that says WeChat and TikTok will be banned in the US in 45 days, if they are not sold by their Chinese owners. WeChat is owned by Tencent while TikTok is owned by Bytedance. Both apps are already banned in India, because of significant concerns around user data privacy and security. The MyJio app is available for Android phones as well as the Apple iPhone. Recent updates have seen the evolution of MyJio from a companion app to manage your mobile or broadband connection, to something of a super app. It now offers a lot more. The basics remain very much in place, with the complete account overview of your prepaid or postpaid plan, managing multiple accounts if you have more than one SIM card and connection and make payments as and when required. The MyJio app is the single app for Jio mobile users as well as the JioFiber broadband services. Yet, that is not all. The MyJio app, at this time, integrates a lot more including JioPay, JioCinema, JioChat, JioNews, JioSaavn, UPI payments for digital payments while shopping or for bill payments including utility bills, JioCloud and JioEngage—some of these are integrated within the app, and some of these are mini-apps that offer extensive functionality without having to download another app on your phone. If you are still not a Jio mobile or a JioFiber subscriber, you can use the app to buy a new Jio connection and get the new SIM card delivered to your doorstep. You can also quickly port to Jio as well, if you are using an Airtel or Vodafone mobile connection. As for the extensive value additions that the MyJio app gets you, streaming remains a priority in these times. The app gives you single tap access to JioSaavn for music streaming. The service has more than 45 million songs listed on the platform at this time. Then there is the JioCinema video streaming service, which bundles movies, TV shows and Originals. Since the subscriptions for these services are included in Jio mobile and JioFiber subscription packs, for instance, access is seamless too. JioPay is one of the most important elements of the MyJio app for Android and iPhone. This is basically your mobile wallet for making digital payments using your credit card or wallets including JioMoney, Paytm and PhonePe. UPI payments are also a critical new addition to the digital payments system in the MyJio app, that lets you make payments at stores and also online for bills and payments directly from your UPI linked bank account. JioNews is the service that includes news curations in more than 13 Indian languages, as well as videos across genres of content, access to more than 250 e-papers of the day's newspapers and more than 800 magazines for you to access. There is also JioEngage that lets you take part in contests and games and win prizes. There is also JioInteract, which is an AI powered virtual assistant that connects you with celebrities. Then there is HelloJio which answers any queries you may have about the service, as a customer. Focused on productivity is the JioCloud service that lets you store files and data on the cloud, accessible within the app, so that you don't have to struggle with multiple cloud storage apps. In a way, the MyJio app does a lot more than simply let you manage your mobile or broadband or data connection. The myriad of services that are integrated within one app ease the pain of using multiple apps for the same tasks. This also takes advantage of Jio's billing and prepaid plans which bundle a lot of these subscription-based services as part of the monthly bill or recharge for the mobile or broadband services, to integrate everything in one place.","WeChat, often classified as a super app at least in China, is in trouble with US President Donald Trump issuing an executive order that says WeChat will be banned in the US in 45 days, if they are not sold by Tencent.

"Red China is in the throes of an impossible Covid situation persisting in 2023, as the Chinese New Year is being celebrated. It is an unstoppable movement of millions to meet with family and go on a holiday, mostly to Thailand, where the Chinese are being let in with minimal restrictions.Complete lockdown of entire cities — ruinous economically — has not prevented the infection of most of the population. The problem is a flawed and ineffective Chinese-made vaccine and a vaccination policy that concentrated on China's armed forces and the young. Coverage was low, sporadic, and never in excess of 30 percent of the population. The Chinese vaccine, exported to Seychelles' island idyll, where the Chinese have garnered influence, resulted in almost the entire population being infected.India's example, in contrast, is nothing short of a golden beacon for friend and foe alike. But recent remembrances were catalysed by the ongoing conference at Davos, with the Pfizer CEO refusing to answer questions on its lousy vaccine, as well as a tweet from Indian Union Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Rajeev Chandrasekhar. The latter pointed at a thick-skinned trio of misinformation peddlers. They are vociferous Congress cheerleaders, including crafty senior lawyer P Chidambaram, still facing various criminal cases, the vacuous Rahul Gandhi, also out on bail on financial irregularity cases, along with his mother Sonia Gandhi, and no-holds-barred amplifier, the impractical and Leftist Jairam Ramesh.All three had bayed for the importation of unproven Western foreign vaccines at the height of the pandemic and had cast doubts on the effectiveness of Indian vaccines being manufactured and disseminated at the time.Pfizer — now criticised globally — initially claimed more than 80 percent efficacy for its vaccine, quite fraudulently, just to boost sales. But it knew the truth internally and therefore asked for indemnity against the vaccine's ineffectiveness from India, which fortunately was not granted. Later, on examination, it was found that the Pfizer vaccine had only 12 percent efficacy and did not prevent transmission. Millions around the world were cheated and harmed. In India, those who think 'West is Best' used Pfizer vaccines too, paying through their nose for vaccines that did not work.The Indian fifth column, true to form, wanted to do everything in their power to derail the Indian response to the pandemic. Their prime agenda was to discredit the Modi government by hook or by crook. India's home-grown vaccine, Covaxin, had 77 percent efficacy and was provided to most people completely free of charge. In addition, millions of doses were donated to other countries and exported to the West. The AstraZeneca and Covishield vaccines, also provided free of cost to many and made under licence in India, had similar levels of effectiveness. Boris Johnson, the UK's former prime minister, was administered Covishield from India and had made a complete recovery.India vaccinated over a billion of its own people using made-in-India Covid vaccines and created herd immunity amongst a massive population of 1.4 billion. This is serving us in good stead today.For an emerging economy born out of centuries of colonial domination by the British, followed by a spiteful British-instigated partition that killed more than half a million people, getting a raw deal has become routine, almost as if it is fated. Initially, it was expected, because of our hopeless anglophile leadership, but persisted for decades after independence, because of continued Indian post-colonial attitudes of servitude and lack of confidence.In fairly recent times also, unequal treaties have been the bane of a weak and politically fragmented coalition government in India. The most humiliating in recent memory was the hard-fought but blighted nuclear power deal. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, ever the installed puppet, made a success of the nuclear power deal, with the out-of-the-way help provided by the Republican US President George W Bush. But the blockers who hate India making progress found another way. They asked for an indemnity against liability for any nuclear accidents for the reactors the Americans supplied. The French followed suit. This bogged it down and the only nuclear reactors commissioned at Kudankulam I and now II are those supplied by old reliable Russia. They are also India's biggest reactors. India and Russia are planning to go ahead with Kudankulam III and IV as well.Of course, the American NGO universe riled up the locals to delay both reactors commissioned in 2013 and 2016 by several years. They did the same to retard the progress of the Narmada Dam which has fed water to large dry areas, also by quite a few years.The fact that an emerging economy like India is now a middle-income economy at No 5 in GDP in the world amongst major economies is leading to a lot of discomfort, not just amongst enemy countries like China and Pakistan, but the G-7 countries of the West too. Combined with a markedly nationalist tone in the conduct of trade, foreign affairs, and defence today, it is giving the erstwhile colonial powers the jitters.We have vastly increased our petroleum imports from Russia, fighting its war with the West, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the European Union and Ukraine. This independent line, which has greatly suited Indian interests, is infuriating to the West. It realises that as long as the Hindu nationalist government succeeds in retaining the confidence of the Indian people, they cannot dominate our policies to suit themselves. As a consequence, the latest salvo is aimed directly at Prime Minister Narendra Modi by the UK government-owned BBC. The national broadcaster has used discredited and unproven innuendo to paint Modi as a communalist, responsible for the Godhra riots of 2002. The purpose of dredging up the topic from 20 years ago is to influence the forthcoming Assembly elections of 2023, and the general elections of 2024, against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The reaction on the ground to BBC's scurrilous propaganda has been sharp and prompt and is likely to consolidate the BJP vote further. Further, efforts of this order from the West bent on maligning and taming the present government in India, cannot be ruled out.However, at the same time, it is being recognised by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and others, that India will become the No 3 economy by 2028 if the BJP wins another majority in 2024. So, the West, led by America, is keen on ostensibly allying with India, particularly in the QUAD, AUKUS, G-20 and other fora, both to contain China and recognise the inevitable rise of a power whose time has come. Other alliances such as the I2U2 (India, Israel, the UAE, and the US) are also full of promise.Middling power such as Britain, burning with post-colonial envy, is setting about it all wrong if it wants to sign an FTA with India in the near future. Not only does India have options, but it is also quite willing to exercise them to its benefit.Making up lies about India may be all that countries like China, Pakistan, Turkey, and indeed their fifth-column supporters are left with. But such shenanigans will neither unseat a highly popular government nor provide any succour in the coming general elections. The visible progress that India is making on multiple fronts is a matter of pride for its citizens, and the Opposition is looking more and more like dangerous anti-national dissidents being aided and abetted by those forces who don't want to see India grow and prosper.

"For a moment, let us leave politics out. It is true that Varanasi is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lok Sabha constituency. It is also true that Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous and politically most important state, goes to the polls in February 2022. Winning Uttar Pradesh is crucial to the BJP's remaining in power not only in the Hindi heartland but perhaps in the whole country.As a run-up to the forthcoming elections in the state, many mega projects are being commenced, completed, or inaugurated. Nationally televised, they give the Modi-Yogi duo an opportunity to showcase their leadership and drive home the point that it is the BJP that has delivered most of its promises. It is the BJP that is dedicated to the progress and development of the state and the country. It is the BJP that the people should trust for their welfare. It is therefore the BJP that should be voted back to power.Yet, as I said at the start, let us leave politics out for a moment. Even if we find that so hard to do, habituated as we are to see everything through a political lens. Instead, let us consider broader, civilisational issues. For, after centuries of colonisation and subjugation, there is so much at stake in India's ongoing renaissance that exceeds and transcends immediate political losses and gains.This is exactly what Narendra Modi demonstrated at the inauguration of the renovated Kashi Vishwanath Mandir complex and corridor to the Ganga on Monday morning. This extraordinary project, completed in a record time of just over two years, recreates the historic shrine precinct of the ancient and timeless city of Kashi, better known as Varanasi or Banaras.It is said that this is the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, with a history of lived occupation going back over 5,000 years. The whole city presided over by Shiva as the Lord of the Universe, is in fact a mandala, a yatra, a potent and powerful spiritual engine designed to shift the consciousness of not only its inhabitants, but also pilgrims who flock to it from all over India and the world.Kashi is a microcosm not only of India but of the cosmos itself. Its sacred geography is surcharged with one primary purpose, its energy-body dedicated to one overwhelming aim. Moksha. Freedom. Emancipation. Liberation. Not only in the hereafter. This is why dying in Kashi is said to confer freedom from the cycle of life and death. But in the here and now.The sacred Ganges turns north here, which means it takes you back to your source, which is the Self. For, we are all nothing but Shiva, nothing but pure consciousness, beyond space, time, birth, decay, and death. We are embodied, no doubt, but we are also timeless and infinite, forever one with the Divine. That is why Kashi is the eternal city.In the presence of the undying and ever-burning funeral pyres, life, in all its richness and plenitude, also thrives, lived at its most intense, with joy and relish. Food, song, erotica, dance, wrestling, scholarship, arts, crafts, business, commerce — all point only to one goal. Self-making, self-realisation and, ultimately, transcendence, transformation.Transforming Kashi has been Modi's passion. From the new airport, there is an expressway that leads to the heart of the city in half an hour. The ghats are cleaner than ever before. The drains and gutters have been repaired. The riverfront has been beautified, with the sacred Ganga also saved and salvaged from much of the sewage, sludge, and industrial waste that used to drain into it.Modi's latest marvel is to expand a less than 3,000 sq ft temple into a 5.5 lakh sq ft complex, which can accommodate 50,000 pilgrims. Over 50 temples and older structures in the corridor were excavated, repaired, and restored in the process. The hundreds of families living in that crowded area were all relocated peacefully, adequately compensated, without prolonged resistance or litigation. No one would have imagined that a project of this sort could have been pulled off. But, as they say, Modi hai to mumkin hai.From Lalita Ghat, pilgrims can now carry water for abhishek to the Lord. The architect, Bimal Patel, was told by the prime minister that the experience of the pilgrimage should be uplifting. No congested and stinky lanes, with a crush of worshippers suffering so much indignity and exploitation. As Mahatma Gandhi himself did when he came to Banaras over a hundred years ago. Yogi Adityanath, the UP Chief Minister, referred to this incident, quipping that in Gandhi's name so many people had come to power, but none of them had carried out his wishes or walked his path.Aurangzeb destroyed the Kashi Vishwanath temple in 1669. Ahilyabai Holkar, the great Maratha queen, rebuilt it in 1780. Maharaja Ranjit Singh gilded the dome in 1835 with a tonne of gold. Many other Hindu rulers, including the Maharajas of Rajasthan and Nepal, tried to protect and restore this shrine. But now, it is Narendra Modi who has exceeded what any of them could accomplish. This is a sign of resurgent India, economically vibrant and culturally at ease with its identity.Yes, from the highest metaphysical point of view, all of us are none other than Shiva. Shivoham, as Shankaracharya famously put it. But it is only Shiva as Modi who can rebuild His own temple. Shiva as the rest of us pilgrims must be elated and grateful. Conversely, Shiva as the members of the opposition or Modi-haters cannot but criticise or defame such efforts. All is Bhole Baba's leela.Likewise, when a civilisation, a people, a community, and a faith tradition are attacked and almost destroyed, a whole nation suffers indignity and humiliation. Desecrated temples and deities, mosques built on top of them, existing shrines in a pathetic or filthy condition, sacred rivers polluted and turned into effluent-carrying drains, corrupt and greedy priests and pandas, superstitions and distortions masquerading as scriptural traditions — all these and more are the symptoms of a wounded civilisation, if not an area of darkness, to invoke the titles of VS Naipaul's books.It is from all these that the nation is being rescued and restored. Whether it is modern infrastructure or spiritual restitution — both are necessary to regain self-respect and strength. Modi, knowing this all too well, said that he had faith in 'Janata Janardan', God-in-the-people. As to the shrine of a deity, he too had come to ask for three boons from his constituency. But these were neither personal nor politics. He sought cleanliness, creativity, and self-reliance, these being the pillars of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. That is why he thanked the humble workers who made his dream come true.Whether Modi wins the next general election or not, whether Yogi Adityanath is re-elected as Uttar Pradesh's chief minister or not, the work they have done in Kashi will not be forgotten. It will last hundreds of years, outliving them and all of us. That is why we should leave politics aside for a while and, once again, applaud Modi as India's millennium man if not a miracle maker. A great disrupter, he is an even greater rebuilder.The author is a professor of English at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

"Sochi: Russia employed an attacking mindset against their World Cup group stage opponents but played defensively in the knockout clash against Spain, and Croatia believe they must be ready for either approach from the hosts in Saturday's quarter-final. The Russians came into the tournament as the lowest-ranked team but began with a bang by beating Saudi Arabia 5-0 and Egypt 3-1 before losing 3-0 to Group A winners Uruguay. They reached the last eight with a win on penalties over Spain. Russia changed tactics to play five at the back with a lone striker in Artem Dzyuba against Spain in the Round of 16 on Sunday, an approach that restricted their opponents to just one chance in 90 minutes. ""Yeah, we have watched almost all of their games,"" Croatia forward Ivan Perisic told reporters at their training base in Sochi on Wednesday. ""Against Spain they used a different system, but you must adapt to every team you play against. So they thought it was the best tactics for them, and I think they made the right decision. ""We will prepare well for both versions. We still have a couple of days to prepare well."" Croatia showed flashes of their stellar attacking game when they beat Nigeria, Argentina and Iceland to top their group. But, like Russia, they took a defensive route to the last eight with a 3-2 shootout win over Denmark. With players such as world-class midfielder Luca Modric and a string of top-level forwards including Mario Mandzukic, Ante Rebic, Andrej Kramaric and Perisic, Zlatko Dalic's team scored at least two goals in each of their three group matches, including firing three past hapless Argentina. ""I think we primarily must focus on ourselves because I think our team has bigger quality, we just need to show that on the pitch and we will be able to set the tone,"" Rebic said. Croatia had a patchy qualifying campaign, slipping from first to third in the group and then sacking coach Ante Cacic in the closing stages. Dalic came in and his side have staked a claim as one of the dark horses in this tournament. ""Every coach has some new ideas, and after a couple of poor games we played... maybe, as we can all see, it turned out for the best,"" Inter Milan forward Perisic added. ""Every coach has his ideas, and after that moment (when the manager was changed) everything improved so we all can only be pleased."" Ever since a talented Croatian side reached the 1998 World Cup semi-finals in their second major tournament as an independent nation, subsequent generations have been under pressure from the country's fans and media to emulate the feat. The current group is one more win away from getting there. ""It's a dream to be in a similar situation,"" Perisic said. ""Now is the time and hopefully we can achieve a similar result. We are really looking forward to the game against Russia.""","Russia employed an attacking mindset against their World Cup group stage opponents but played defensively in the knockout clash against Spain, and Croatia believe they must be ready for either approach from the hosts in Saturday's quarter-final.",
"As several parts of Delhi-NCR continue to reel from a flood-like situation after Yamuna's water level rose to an all-time high, residents of these areas have become vulnerable to several health-related risk factors. Health experts told News18 that the recent flooding poses significant health risks to the residents, particularly those living along the riverbanks. One of the top concerns is that the stagnant water becomes a breeding ground for insects and mosquitoes, which provides space for the growth of bacteria, viruses, and parasites.Waterlogging also increases the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, zika, dengue, and hepatitis.'Stagnant water can become a breeding ground for disease-causing organisms which increases the risk of cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and hepatitis A,' Dr Manjeeta Nath Das, senior consultant, internal medicine, at Narayana Superspeciality Hospital in Gurugram, told News18.Also, contaminated water can enter the drinking water supply, leading to widespread infections, said Dr Nitin Rathi, senior consultant, pulmonology, at Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital in Delhi.Echoing a similar concern, Rathi said that waterlogging creates favourable conditions for mosquito breeding, increasing the prevalence of diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and zika virus.Asthma, allergy, and fungal infectionsAccording to doctors, prolonged exposure to damp environments can lead to respiratory issues including allergies, asthma, and bronchitis.Mould growth and increased humidity contribute to the release of airborne allergens and respiratory irritants.Rathi explained that frequent contact with waterlogged areas can cause various skin infections, such as fungal infections, dermatitis, and cellulitis.'Bacteria and fungi thrive in moist conditions, and when they come into contact with broken or compromised skin, infections can occur,' he said.Apart from physical illnesses, such conditions make people vulnerable to mental illnesses as well.Aishwarya Raj, a clinical psychologist, explained that continuous waterlogging can lead to heightened levels of anxiety and stress.'The uncertainty and disruption caused by the flooded surroundings can create a sense of helplessness and insecurity, making individuals feel overwhelmed,' she said.Raj added that this could make people experience fear and trauma due to the potential risks associated with waterlogging, such as the fear of being trapped, the loss of property, or the fear of contracting waterborne diseases.'In areas affected by waterlogging, people may be isolated from their usual social networks,' she said, adding that 'it is important to note that the impact of waterlogging on mental health can vary from person to person.'What to do?The first rule is to avoid contact with stagnant water and ensure it does not touch food or utensils.According to Dr Kamal Verma, senior consultant, department of internal medicine, at Amrita Hospital, Faridabad, residents should boil water to ensure its safety for drinking purposes.'Apply mosquito repellent creams and utilise mosquito nets at home,' said Dr Verma.Das from Narayana Superspeciality Hospital also advised people to maintain personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing with soap and clean water.One of the ways to protect against mosquito-related diseases is to eliminate stagnant water around living areas to prevent mosquito breeding apart from wearing long sleeves and pants.Also, waterlogging can obscure hazards beneath the surface, leading to accidental injuries like slips, falls, or drowning.'Be cautious of hidden debris, open manholes, or uncovered drains. If you must be in waterlogged areas, use appropriate safety equipment and follow guidelines provided by local authorities,' Nath warned.","According to doctors, prolonged exposure to damp environments can lead to respiratory issues including allergies, asthma, and bronchitis. Mould growth and increased humidity contribute to the release of airborne allergens and respiratory irritants",
"Taiwan is finding it difficult to keep itself out of international headlines. The island nation, home to just 23 million people, has found itself the recipient of Beijing's ire in the form of heated rhetoric and military incursions into Taiwanese airspace.Between October 1 and 4, Taiwan reported close to 150 incursions of Chinese aircraft into the former's Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ). Shortly after, Chinese President Xi Jinping made a speech vowing that 'the historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled'.In response, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-Wen made clear that Taipei would not bow to pressure from Beijing and articulated a growing desire in Taiwan to chart a path independent of Beijing. These tensions, seen in the broader context of perceived Chinese aggression globally, US-China competition in Asia and China's enhanced military capabilities have left many convinced that Beijing is signalling its intention to settle the Taiwan question through force.Beijing's interest, nay obsession, with Taiwan stems from a toxic cocktail of history, colonialism and nationalism. While Taiwan was largely left to its own devices for much of its history, Beijing established a tenuous control over the island in the 17th century only to lose it to a rising Imperial Japan at the close of the 19th century. The loss of Taiwan, simply one in a long line of humiliations suffered by China during the colonial era, forms part of the Chinese Communist Party's narrative of a 'Century of Humiliation' that shapes much of the nation's modern nationalism.Once Japan surrendered in World War II, ownership of Taiwan returned to the then nationalist government of China led by Chiang Kai-Shek. Chiang's administration soon found itself in a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists; by 1949, Chiang realised that the war was lost and fled to the small island base of Taiwan. Despite numerous attempts to decisively end the conflict since both sides have become entrenched in their respective territories.As the CCP bases much of its modern-day legitimacy on undoing the horrors of the 'Century of Humiliation' and uniting China under one banner, Taiwan represents an unfinished task that would complete the CCP's project. With this in mind, one may be forgiven for believing that President Xi's talk of 'reunification' with Taiwan amounts to a tacit declaration of Beijing's military designs on the island nation.However, it is helpful to place President Xi's statements on Taiwan in the broader historical context. Nothing that Xi has said thus far deviates from the script Beijing has followed on Taiwan for some decades now. While Xi stated that reunification with Taiwan was inevitable, he is far from the only Chinese premier to have made that statement. Indeed, during his speech at the 100th CCP anniversary conference, he mentioned his commitment to peaceful reunification without linking it to his much-vaunted 'national rejuvenation' plans.Taiwan is no stranger to a heated war of words with Beijing. When President Chen Shui-Bian openly called for Taiwanese independence in the early 2000s, mainland Chinese officials made clear that the Straits were 'entering a period of high danger'. Such rhetoric has not been seen today given that President Tsai is a canny politician who has argued for charting an independent course for Taiwan without speaking of outright independence.What then explains Beijing's military provocations in recent weeks?There are, in this author's view, two driving forces for Beijing's increased belligerence: One is domestic politics in Taiwan, and the other is international support for and — interest in — Taiwan.Top leaders in Zhongnanhai (China's Raisina) are concerned at swelling support for politicians like Tsai Ing-Wen at a time when support for engaging Beijing has all but disappeared. Nowhere has this been clearer than with the collapse of the 1992 Consensus. While the Consensus is notoriously hard to pin down, it broadly refers to an unofficial understanding between Beijing and Taipei that there exists only One China.Further, the Consensus allows for different interpretations of what One China truly means. While Taipei (formally the Republic of China) staked a claim to being the legitimate Chinese government, Beijing did the same. This helped reassure Beijing that Taiwan would not attempt to bolt from the stable and declare formal independence.The 1992 Consensus and Beijing's desperation to maintain it say much about what China really wants from Taiwan. While the CCP can begrudgingly accept a functionally independent Taiwan, it dreads a future in which Taiwan declares formal independence. For a highly nationalistic state that prides itself on its record on territorial sovereignty, such an action would necessitate a military response. However, the CCP would risk not only its global ambitions for China by getting embroiled in a military conflict, but also its very existence should it come off worse in such a showdown with Taiwan.For a time, Beijing could rest easy. While President Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party opposed the 1992 Consensus, the Kuomintang (KMT), once the party of Chiang Kai Shek, supported it. However, the political ground in Taiwan began to shift in 2020, when Tsai won a second consecutive term by handily defeating the pro-engagement KMT candidate.Tsai's victory came in the larger backdrop of increasing scepticism about China among Taiwan's citizens. As Chinese security forces crushed protests in Hong Kong, many in Taiwan soured on the idea of greater engagement and unification with the mainland.Tsai's more confrontational stance concerning Beijing rescued her faltering government and sparked a crisis among younger members of the KMT who have publicly called for the party to reconsider its support for the 1992 Consensus. Taiwan's citizens increasingly identify as exclusively Taiwanese and do not feel a connection to China that defined the generations that came before them.Faced with rapidly disappearing support for unification, Beijing is worried that it faces a closing window of opportunity before any form of accommodation with mainland China becomes a political non-starter in Taiwan and independence becomes a real possibility.Second, Taiwan's troubles with Beijing have attracted tremendous attention and international support. Taiwan's time in the sun began when the small island nation led one of the industrialised world's most effective responses to the Covid-19 epidemic. Given this, many in the international community felt that the world could benefit from Taiwan's knowhow and pandemic management experience and supported its entry into the World Health Organization.While this bid failed given China's long-standing opposition to Taiwanese membership, it did pull Taiwan into the international spotlight. Further, Beijing's aggression vis-à-vis Taiwan has occurred at a time when China's perceived aggression towards its neighbours has turned head internationally. Support for Taiwan has exploded with everyone from former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott to a grouping of French senators lining up to visit Taiwan.While this explains Beijing's enhanced threat perception when it comes to Taiwan, it still doesn't quite explain why it has chosen military provocations to make its point. Understanding Chinese thinking, it helps to jump back to the 1990s. During this period, a newly democratised Taiwan flirted openly with the idea of proclaiming independence from Beijing. Worried by what it saw occurring across the Strait, Beijing stepped up its military activities in the Straits. Several military exercises and one Taiwan Straits Crisis later, the good folk of Taiwan concluded that the prickly question of independence should be kicked down the road.This was made abundantly clear in the 1996 presidential election when the DPP candidate calling for independence suffered serious setbacks. Pro-independence politicians took the hint and the can was kicked down the road. Taiwan's citizens understood that while Beijing did not seriously expect unification to be a workable goal, it could not stand for an outright declaration of independence. Through its military pressure, Beijing may be borrowing its playbook from its earlier success in tamping down enthusiasm for independence.Any possible solution to the ongoing crisis will require both sides to commit to the same process of dialogue that produced the 1992 Consensus. While Taiwan's political leadership is unlikely to push for independence, it is clear that a political formula based on eventual reunification will run into fierce opposition domestically. Taiwan increasingly hopes to carve out its own identity and free itself from the burden of fulfilling the dreams of an earlier generation of Chinese who wished to reconquer China under one banner. Ultimately, Presidents Tsai and Xi would prefer to bring down tensions and hammer out a new consensus to reflect new political realities in Taiwan.While both leaders might hope to kick the can down the road and deprioritise independence as a goal, Tsai's reluctance to accept the One-China principle will be a significant sticking point. The world will have to wait and watch.The author is a research associate, strategic studies programme, Observer Research Foundation (ORF)(The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent the stand of this publication.)Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.","Between October 1 and 4, Taiwan reported close to 150 incursions of Chinese aircraft into the former's Air Defence Identification Zone",
"We are facing an ever increasing caseload of Covid-19, which has reached 20,000 new cases every day. There is also an additional threat of monkeypox, which has been detected in India and has been declared a Global Health Emergency. Countries such as India and the UK have even advised airborne precautions pointing towards a risk of easy spread through respiratory droplets. Although, not as easily as Covid-19. Masks, social distancing and vaccinations are existing tools, which are helping us fight Covid-19 and monkeypox. One important tool that we as a country have not used is indoor ventilation. Indoor ventilation means putting outdoor air inside and removing indoor air to reduce the risk of infection.With an increase in building hospitals with sealed windows, ventilation has reduced. This decrease in ventilation is also responsible for an increase in risk of infections.Ventilation is affected by several things including direction of wind, size of the inlet, impedance to air flow. The World Health Organisation recommends using ventilation along with other measures to reduce infections. This assumes greater importance in hospitals and clinics, which have infected and susceptible people in the same complex. A baseline measurement of ventilation should be made and a minimum required ventilation rate be calculated depending on occupancy and the type of people in the facility. In places where it is not possible to increase natural airflow, adding mechanical airflow devices is recommended. This includes standalone air purifiers with HEPA filters, which became quite popular in highly polluted northern parts of the country. In a country like India, where there is a burden of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, there is an added barrier of mosquito nets, which have to be put on windows. This drastically reduces the air flow.Measures such as using a fan, which pushes outside air inside, changing the direction of the flow from the clean part to the contaminated area or the more populated areas, keeping at least an area of 4 metres from the outlet free from humans or even animals are highly prescribed. Recent research suggests letting the room ventilate for at least 15 minutes before using it. Regular cleaning of the air filters in air purifiers and air conditioners is also quite important. Negative pressure machinery is the gold standard for hospital rooms with infected patients. A state information and education campaign along with incrementally including ventilation requirements in building codes specially for healthcare facilities is the right way to go. Improving ventilation also has other positive effects on health. It leads to reduction in all other infections that are transmitted by air such as tuberculosis, common cold and chickenpox. Respiratory pathway remains the most efficient way a pathogen can transmit and infect a large number of people. We have to be vigilant and reduce the chances of air transmission of such pathogens. With an increase in interaction between humans and animals, a more interconnected world and people now living in much more close proximity in cities, the chances of an infection increases drastically. Ventilating our indoor spaces will help us prepare for future devastating infections, which will most likely spread via the air we breathe.Harshit Kukreja is Research Analyst, The Takshashila Institution.

"The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) has issued notices to 300 odd school teachers asking them to show cause why they were absent on March 10, the day of a strike demanding increased dearness allowance (DA), disobeying the state government's instruction to remain present.A WBBSE official on Wednesday said that the show cause notices were issued to the teachers of various schools across the state.WBBSE President Ramanuj Ganguly told PTI that the Board only followed the state government's recommendations on the issue.'We went by the reports of the District Inspector of schools and heads of respective educational institutions about the presence of teaching staff on March 10 and implemented the directive of the state secretariat,' Ganguly said.While he did not specify the total number of teachers, the WBBSE official said the number was a little over 300.A forum of 18 state government employees' organisations had called the strike on March 10 demanding a hike in DA.The West Bengal government issued an order saying that all offices including those provided with grants-in-aid by the state such as educational institutions shall remain open on March 10 and all employees will report for duty on that day and no leave will be granted for that day.Read all the Latest Education News here",A WBBSE official on Wednesday said that the show cause notices were issued to the teachers of various schools across the state,A WBBSE official on Wednesday said that the show cause notices were issued to the teachers of various schools across the state.
"Merely an hour before the big opposition meeting in Patna - hosted by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and attended by 30 leaders from 15 parties - the AAP accused the Congress of making a compromise with the ruling BJP for presidency. The party's Delhi spokesperson, Priyanka Kakkar, said the Congress needed to clear its stand on the matter.The statement has not gone down well with the Congress leadership and said this did not look good for opposition unity. Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge told chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, when he asked him about the party's stand on the Delhi ordinance, that there was a process to be followed before making such decisions and the party will make its stand clear in the coming days.After the meeting, there was a press conference by the opposition parties that Kejriwal, Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, AAP leaders Sanjay Singh and Raghav Chadha skipped. Instead, the party issued a statement: 'The Congress, a national party that takes a stand on almost all issues, is yet to make its position on the black ordinance public. However, the Delhi and Punjab units of the Congress have announced that the party should support the Modi government on this issue.''Today, during the like-minded party meeting in Patna, many parties urged the Congress to publicly denounce the black ordinance. However, the Congress refused to do so,' it said.It added: 'The silence of the Congress raises suspicion on its real intention. In personal discussions, senior Congress leaders have hinted that their party might informally or formally abstain from voting on the issue in the Rajya Sabha. Its abstention from voting on this issue will help the BJP immensely in furthering its attack on Indian democracy.'The statement also pointed out that till the Congress took a stand on the issue, it will be difficult for the AAP to take part in future meetings of the opposition. 'The black ordinance is anti-constitutional, anti-federalism, and outright undemocratic. Furthermore, it seeks to reverse the Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgment on the issue and is an affront to the judiciary. The hesitation and refusal to act as a team player by the Congress, especially on an issue as important as this one, would make it very difficult for the AAP to be part of any alliance that includes the Congress. Until the Congress publicly denounces the black ordinance and declares that all 31 of its MPs will oppose the ordinance in the Rajya Sabha, it will be difficult for AAP to participate in future meetings of like-minded parties where the Congress is a participant,' it said.Congress sources suggested that the meeting in Patna was to discuss strategies for the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections and not to discuss only one issue. 'We are in a process to reach a consensus on the issue and, once we do, we will inform the AAP. Issuing such a statement is unfortunate. We will be hosting the next opposition meeting in Shimla, it is up to the AAP if it wants to be part of it,' sources said.","Only an hour before the opposition meeting in Patna, AAP's Delhi spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said the Congress needed to clear its stand on the matter",
"Chauri Chaura in Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur district is remembered in history books for the incident in 1922 when fire was opened at freedom fighters, who burnt down the police station here, killing policemen, and Mahatma Gandhi had to call off the Non-Cooperation Movement. This region of Purvanchal has also a good presence of Nishads, and the Nishad Party is now a BJP ally. In Chauri Chaura, Nishad Party supremo Sanjay Nishad's younger son, Sarvan Kumar, 31, is contesting his first election against a Samajwadi Party candidate who is a former pilot of GoAir Airlines, Brajesh Pasi.'We got 16 seats, out of which 11 are being fought from Nishad Party symbol and five from the BJP symbol. I am myself contesting on a BJP ticket. UP's 160 seats have strong a presence of Nishads,' Sarvan Nishad told News18 in Chauri Chaura. His elder brother, Praveen Nishad, had shocked all by defeating the BJP in the Lok Sabha by-poll in Gorakhpur in 2018, backed by the SP.Sarvan Kumar Nishad, who is contesting his first election, is pitted against an SP candidate who is a former pilot. (Photo: News18)Praveen Nishad is now the BJP MP from Sant Kabir Nagar. 'Nishad Party always brings earthquakes in politics and this time a big win for the BJP will come in UP as we are in alliance with the BJP. The Nishad voter is directly connected with the Nishad Party. Earlier, this voter was unconscious and other parties used them, terming them as saleable. Since we have come into existence, Nishad voters are aware and the results were seen in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,' Sarvan Nishad says.In the nearby Junglerasool village in Chauri Chaura, Nishads say their community plays a bigger role in making the UP government. 'Nishads have always been Lord Ram bakhts. Lord Ram and Nishad Raj were friends and hence Nishads always remain connected with a party that has aaastha with Lord Ram which is the BJP,' the village Pradhan, Ram Sewak Nishad said.Nishads have long demanded inclusion in the Scheduled Caste category as they are part of OBCs currently. However, another local, Ramesh, says if education improves, then reservation may also be needed but is not 'that important'. 'Reservation is not a big issue, if one studies well, they will get good jobs,' Ramesh says. Other locals, Balram and Ram Adhar, say with Ram Mandir being made and Nishads getting government benefits, 'Nishads are completely satisfied with the BJP.' The Samajwadi Party here has given a ticket to former GoAir pilot Brajesh Pasi, who is from the Pasi community, which has a significant voter population here too. 'The SP will be wiped out — in villages, people are driving away the SP. They kept villages in the dark without electricity and gobbled up rations. The pilot candidate against me from the SP is hawa-hawai and will remain up in air,' Sarvan Nishad told News18.The Samajwadi Party here has given a ticket to former GoAir pilot Brajesh Pasi.

"Indian Idol, a very popular, not to be confused with great, singing reality show based on British musical programme Pop Idol, has launched some careers and brought many talents to the limelight. Though it never touched the level of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, it is still quite a watchable show, to some extent because of the judges' unique comments. From Anu Malik to Farah Khan to Javed Akhtar to Sonali Bendre, who hasn't been a judge on Indian Idol! They bring their own perspectives and decide whether a contestant is good enough to be called an 'idol'! It's other thing that it takes time to recall the past winners apart from one Abhijit Sawant! Ardent fans may remember Salman Ali too but that would be mostly because of his viral 'jugalbandi' videos on social media. In short, the show has probably lost a good part of the initial charm it started with. However, Indian Idol has now stoked a new and bizarre controversy which might extend its shelf life for a couple of weeks. Amit Kumar, singer and son of the legendary Kishore Kumar, was invited as a guest on the show recently. Apparently, he wasn't happy with the quality of the singers and chose the Times of India to vent his frustration. He told TOI, 'Frankly, I wanted to stop the episode.' He also said, 'I did what I was told. I was told 'sabko praise kamana hai'. I was told 'jo jaisa bhi gaaye usko uplift karna hai' because it's a tribute to Kishore da. I thought it will be a homage to my father. But once there, I just followed what I was asked to do. I had told them to give me portions of the script in advance, but nothing of that sort happened.'As expected, it didn't go well with the people involved with the show. Lyricist Manoj Muntashir, who was filling in for one of the judges in the ongoing season, was quick to point out Amit Kumar's error in judgment. Muntashir said, 'If Amit Kumar came out and lashed out at the show, he shouldn't have agreed to be a part of it in the first place. He took money for being a part of the show and then criticised it. I wouldn't have done what Amit Kumar did. If I was in his place and not comfortable with the proceedings, I would have told the makers that I don't want to be a part of the show.'The operating words were 'took money' here. I, for one, didn't know that guests come in exchange of money on reality shows. I might be living under the rock but I always thought it's either for a film's promotion or a goodwill gesture. After all, the guests are also part of the same fraternity and why wouldn't they want to witness budding talents? Also, isn't it a goodwill gesture on their as well as the makers' part? The guest's face value remains intact and the makers get a respectable name. Simple give and take. But then came the money part which has the potential to entirely change the dynamics.Meanwhile, came the episode dedicated to the late composer Shravan Rathod. Kumar Sanu, Anuradha Paudwal and Roopkumar Rathod were invited as guests. The host Aditya Narayan took a sly dig at the guests and asked them whether they were asked to praise the participants. To which, Kumar Sanu replied, 'They are really great singers and performed amazingly. All of them could pass off as playback singers right now. I have never seen so many talented people on one reality show. Each one of them is a heera (gem).'It was a way of demonstrating that everything is normal on the show and the makers have moved on from Amit Kumar's comments, but it's not like that. The debate is still there: Was Amit Kumar right in going by the instructions? Did he do the right thing by opening up to the media? One by one, the first part, if he has been paid to be on the show then in a way, he complied with the rules set by the makers. They both should have discussed their respective clauses. Amit Kumar was still free to voice his honest opinion, but he chose not to. If he did and the makers edited out that part or stopped him from saying whatever he wanted then he could have a stronger case. But he complied. Here, it is important to hear what singer Sunidhi Chauhan has to say. She told ETimes, 'Not exactly this that everyone had to do this, but yes, we all were told (to praise). That was the basic thing. And so, I couldn't go on. I couldn't do what they wanted and I had to part ways. Hence, today, I am not judging any reality show.'It's a fair stance. The guests are not forced but paid. These are two different things. There is another old Indian Idol video going viral in which Sonu Nigam is criticising former contestant Rahul Vaidya in no vague words. Nigam is pointed, defined and precise. Basically, the judges could say whatever they felt like the contestants. The basic nature of the show hasn't changed, and thus it's not wise on Amit Kumar's part to not say the exact things he wanted while on the show. None of the celebrity guests are unaware of how to politely present their point of view. Also, it was a celebration of Kishore Kumar's career, and it should be taken in that spirit. There have been guests who sang with the contestants and corrected them during performance, so Amit Kumar could have been a little more tactful. That answers the second part, no?Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.",The debate is: Was Amit Kumar right in going by the instructions?

"Purported images of two pages of Life Science question paper of the class 12 state board examination surfaced on WhatsApp on Saturday, over two and half hours after the commencement of the test.The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, which conducts the exam, said this could not be termed a paper leak and described it as an act of mischief.Council President Chiranjib Bhattacharya said some vested interests must have circulated the image of the question paper long after it had begun, when it was almost nearing close.'If the images are circulated two and half hours after the exam started, what is the big deal? Candidates can leave the exam hall by that time and if anyone clicks a pic of two pages outside the venue and circulates them on social media, that does not in any way reflect on the conduct of the exams,' Bhattacharya told PTI.He appealed to the 'mischief mongers' to desist from such 'childish pranks' and help smoothly conduct the ongoing exams in the interest of every candidate.Bhattacharya added that CCTV surveillance at 2349 venues and the use of Radio Frequency Devices in some of the over 200 sensitive venues to detect presence of any electronic devices made it almost impossible for the scope of a question paper leak.Still, the Council is on guard, he said.Sensitive venues are located in various districts and the highest of them are in Malda.Bhattacharya said the Council was tracking the source of the circulation of question paper on WhatsApp and will submit a report to the government.While there had been reports of question paper images circulated on WhatsApp in the class 10 state board examinations this year, in 2019 and earlier, this is the first time that such an incident is reported during the higher secondary (HS) exam in recent times.The HS exams began in West Bengal on March 14.Read all the Latest Education News here","The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, which conducts the exam, said this could not be termed a paper leak and described it as an act of mischief","The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, which conducts the exam, said this could not be termed a paper leak and described it as an act of mischief."

"You are working from home. The internet is your lifeline. You even upgrade to a faster 100Mbps, 200Mbps, 300Mbps or a superfast 1Gbps internet plan, in the hope that all the file transfers, web browsing, sending heavy mail attachments and the other plethora of work would be smooth. But what happens if the internet you rely on so heavily decides to act up. The thing is, more often than not, we blame our internet service provider (ISP). In a cacophony of curses, gritted teeth and hair pulling, we blame poor services for the unreliable connectivity and poor speeds. However, that isn't always the case. Your internet line isn't to be blamed for many cases of poor internet speeds. So, where does the blame lie? For starters, your modem or router could be, and most likely is, the bottleneck. Here is what you need to do. First, restart the router and see if the speeds return to normal, only to revert to inconsistent, low or no connectivity eventually. First Layer of Troubleshooting You must do a speed test (www.speedtest.com; free apps for Android and iOS) ideally on a PC connected hardwired to the internet line via LAN to a laptop, to understand what kind of speed dip you're suffering from. These speed tests also offer additional data such as ping rates and connectivity stability graphs. These give you a fairly good picture of what is up, including whether the wireless connectivity is to be blamed. Check your hardware For most old routers are limited to 2.4GHz wireless networks and cannot support the faster 5GHz networks which is what you ideally need for internet lines faster than 50Mbps. Obviously, then, data transmissions speeds and quality will suffer, since nearby devices such as your microwave oven and cordless phones which also work on the 2.4GHz band, and therefore cause interference. You may need a router that supports the faster 'wireless ac"" standard too. At times, the router that ISPs provide is quite basic, which means that while it ticks off the basics required for it to work with a fast internet line, it doesn't really have the power to either support multiple high bandwidth devices or just doesn't have the Wi-Fi range. Next course of action: Buy a new router It may just be time to buy a new Wi-Fi router for home, if work from home is a reality for you. And here are some of the best options, across different price points. TP-Link Touch P5 AC1900 Around Rs 6,000 on Amazon If you feel your home gets fully covered by Wi-Fi signals from a conventional single base router, then the Touch P5 AC1900 from TP-Link is a rather swanky option to consider. It can go as fast as 1,300Mbps on the 5GHz networks and 600Mbps on the 2.4GHz networks, which means a fast internet line really brings out of the best of this router. The party piece has to be the touchscreen control system for setup and network management. Beam forming tech focuses the Wi-Fi coverage towards where the devices are at that time, which should also help in getting better coverage and speeds in the farthest corners of the home. Netgear Orbi RBK12 Around Rs 9,999 Why would you not go for a Wi-Fi mesh system at this price and make do with a conventional router? What you get is one router and one satellite. The router is to be hooked up directly to your internet line, while the satellite can be placed in a further corner of your home to ensure seamless connectivity all through. This router and mesh combo can cover up to 3,000 square feet of indoor space, which will mean a rather nice headroom for even large apartments and homes. This dual-band setup offers the 2.4GHz band that goes up to a maximum of 400Mbps speed and a 5GHz band that does up to 866Mbps speed. The Netgear app for your phone (free for Android and iPhone) lets you set up and monitor the mesh system from there. Good for internet lines around 500Mbps. Linksys Velop AC2600 Around Rs 9,999 This started out in life with a much higher price tag, but corrections over time have seen this two-unit combo now fall under the Rs 10,000 price point. What you get is coverage of up to 3,000 square feet of indoor space—which means one node gets connected with the internet line and the other can be placed somewhere else in your home for effectively zero Wi-Fi dead zones in your home. The Linksys app (free for Android and iOS) is quite slick to use as well. This dual-band setup offers the 2.4GHz band that goes up to a maximum of 400Mbps speed and a 5GHz band that does up to 867Mbps speed. Good for internet lines around 500Mbps speeds. Netgear Nighthawk AX4 4-Stream AX3000 Around Rs 14,000 This is the futureproof router that you need if Wi-Fi 6 is what you were waiting for and have a plan in place to buy compatible devices as well. This dual band 2.4GHz and dual band 5GHz, with up to 600Mbps on 2.4GHz and up to 2,400Mbps on the faster 5GHz bands. Beneath the rather futuristic exterior sits a dual core processor that drives a lot of functionality, including the Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) which splits transmission signals into smaller data packets allowing better data access for multiple devices that may be connected to the internet at the same time. Each device has to wait less for data transmission, there is improved latency and the mobile devices consume less battery on Wi-Fi networks.",For most old routers are limited to 2.4GHz wireless networks and cannot support the faster 5GHz networks which is what you ideally need for internet lines faster than 50Mbps.,
"A home broadband line is certainly categorized as a necessity now, in the era of work from home. No longer can you brush aside a wired broadband line for home as an avoidable additional expense. To get work done remotely, for your child's online classes and for streaming Netflix once you desperately need to unwind after work, the reality is that our 3G and 4G mobile networks may just not be geared up for the tasks at hand. Also because of the unique situation where a large demographic is working from home, there is more load on the mobile networks in residential areas. Yet, a home broadband line is still something a lot of people cannot spend a lot on or choose not to spend a lot on. And that often inevitably leads to the question—what is the cheapest broadband connection that I can buy for home? All popular broadband service providers, or internet service providers, have really interesting entry spec plans that don't really hurt the wallet. Reliance JioFiber, Airtel Xstream broadband, ACT broadband, BSNL, Tata Sky Broadband, Excitel and others all have plans that work out around the Rs 500 price point, give or take a bit, with speeds ranging between 30Mbps to 50Mbps, depending on provider plans. And in the case of Excitel, 100Mbps speeds in case you go for the long-term recharge.Reliance Jio really forced the competition to make broadband more affordable with the new JioFiber broadband plans last year. The JioFiber Rs 399 broadband plan offers you symmetric upload and download speeds of 30Mbps. You'll get a home phone as well which offers unlimited voice calls across India. The data usage bundled with this plan is unlimited, in the sense that you'll have a monthly fair usage policy (FUP) cap of 3300GB per month after which the speeds will reduce for the rest of the billing cycle—though you will not have to pay extra at any point. The response to the JioFiber plan rejigs last year saw Airtel Xstream getting a new Airtel Xstream Unlimited broadband plan that is priced at Rs 499 per month and offers 40Mbps speeds. The data usage is unlimited, with an FUP of 3333GB per month. You'll get a landline phone as well with unlimited local and national voice calls and subscriptions to the Airtel Xstream video streaming service and the Wynk Music streaming service.The state run BSNL is in no mood to let the private ISPs run away with the market share and attractive affordable broadband plans. In most circles, BSNL offers the Fibre Basic broadband plan which is priced at Rs 449 per month and offers 30Mbps speeds. It is slightly more expensive than the Reliance JioFiber broadband plan, in terms of pure monthly cost. You'll get an FUP of 3300GB per month and a landline phone which allows for unlimited local and national calls. Yet, MTNL which offers broadband services in Delhi and Mumbai, has listed the entry spec plan for its fiber broadband service as the FTH-777 plan which costs Rs 777 per month and gets you 100Mbps speeds with 800GB data per month at high speeds and the any usage beyond that at 1Mbps for the rest of the billing cycle.Tata Sky Broadband has an entry spec 50Mbps broadband plan which is available if you choose to pay in advance for 3 months, 6 months or 12 months. While the other plans which offers 100Mbps speeds or more have the monthly billing option, this doesn't. Nevertheless, you'll pay Rs 1797 for 3 months, Rs 3300 for 6 months and Rs 6000 for 12 months. This works out to around Rs 599 per month, around Rs 550 per month and around Rs 500 per month respectively. Excitel, a broadband service that is available in multiple cities in India including Delhi NCR, has the Fiber First 100Mbps unlimited data plan in the prepaid avatar. This means the more months you pay for in advance, the lesser the price you pay. For instance, it'll cost Rs 699 per month with the monthly billing but cost Rs 565 per month if you pay for three months in advance, Rs 508 per month if you pay for 4 months in advance and as low as Rs 399 per month if you pay for an entire year upfront. To be fair, Excitel is offering significantly faster 100Mbps speeds for around the same sort of monthly outlay, as a lot of the other ISPs charging for 40Mbps or 50Mbps. Last but not least is ACT Broadband, which has listed the ACT Swift broadband plan in certain cities. This gets you 50Mbps speeds with unlimited data that has an FUP of 3300GB data per month. Not the most affordable either, priced at Rs 710 per month. Mind you, while most users may never get close to the FUP limit particularly on 50Mbps broadband plans, ACT does penalize heavy users by reducing the speeds to 512kbps for the rest of the billing cycle. In certain other cities, there is the ACT Starter plan listed at Rs 549 per month that gets you 40Mbps speeds.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.

Head to the Netflix Streamfest site and set up a reminder. You will be notified when the Netflix StreamFest is about to start. You can then create a Netflix account and start watching movies and TV shows on the streaming app. You can create this account for free and there is no need to make any payment at this time or link a credit or debit card to the Netflix account just yet. To sign up though, you will need to either do it on the Netflix StreamFest website or via the Android app. However, once you have made the Netflix account, you can then use any device or platform that Netflix is available on, to access the movies and TV shows—that includes Android TV, Smart TVs, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Apple iPhone, Apple iPad, Apple TV, Sony PlayStation consoles and more. Do remember though, the streams for the Netflix Streamfest users will be in standard definition (SD). In India, Netflix at present offers four subscription plans. The Mobile-only Rs 199 plan offers streaming at up to 480p resolution and can be used only with the Netflix mobile apps. The Basic Rs 499 plan also offers maximum 480p resolution streaming and can be used on any mobile, TV or PC, but streaming is limited to one screen at a time. The Standard plan priced at Rs 649 offers Full HD resolution streaming with the ability to simulcast Netflix on two screens at the same time. The highest tier Premium plan is priced at Rs 799 per month and streams 4K + HDR content and can be viewed on up to 4 screens at the same time.It was in October that Netflix had confirmed this event for India. 'We think that giving everyone in a country access to Netflix for free for a weekend could be a great way to expose a bunch of new people to the amazing stories that we have. Really creating an event, and hopefully get a bunch of those folks to sign up,' said Greg Peters, Chief Product Officer at Netflix, had said during the quarterly earnings call.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here","The Netflix StreamFest starts on December 5 and ends at the close of December 6.

"I've often been confused about owning an iPad. Back when the first generation iPad Pro was released, I was excited about the prospect of a slim tablet replacing my rather bulky work laptop. In about a year that I used it, I tried to overlook its flaws for the benefits, but software wise, tablets just weren't ready to replace a full-scale desktop OS. Since then, a lot has changed - the world has seen a pandemic, Cristiano Ronaldo has returned to Manchester United, and I have come to realise that my perspective towards tablets might have been skewered. The latter, in large part, has happened in the past two weeks, thanks to the Apple iPad Mini 6, or iPad Mini 2021 - whatever you'd like to call it.The iPad Mini 6 is a balance of screen size, form factor and portability, an important formula that frequent travellers would prioritise once the pandemic recedes. It has also made me realise that the purpose of a tablet is not just to replace a laptop, but fill its absence. Before you jump to conclusions, I also believe that Apple should have made a keyboard for the iPad Mini 6 to fill the laptop's absence better, but once you start spending time with it, you'd realise that this does you more good than bad. Here's why.Form factor and portability: Almost pocketableTo state that the iPad Mini 6 is compact is to state the obvious - it is, after all, from the 'Mini' family of Apple's hardware. You get an 8.3-inch display on a tablet that is 7.7 inches in height, and 5.3 inches in width. It is also 6.3mm thick, and weighs 297 grams for the cellular version, which is what we have with us. In comparison, the new Apple iPhone 13 Pro is 7.7mm thick and weighs 205 grams. The latter feels heavier in-hand because on the iPad, the weight is not proportionately higher, and is better distributed too.Apple iPad Mini 6 review: The overall form factor is among the best in terms of portability and ease of usage when you travel or work on the desk. (Image: Shouvik Das/News18.com)All of this makes the iPad Mini 6 one of the easiest to carry, and you can stow it anywhere in your bag without worrying. It is easy to grip and operate with one hand, especially with an Apple Smart Folio cover slapped on. On desks, the iPad Mini 6 is a good second display to add to compact laptops without it taking up a lot of space, helping you to avoid switching between windows and tabs constantly, when writing. This actually helps reduce distractions, and its compact footprint means it's great for small or loaded desks.On the move, the iPad Mini 6 is about the right size to watch a movie on, without being too small or distractingly large. Holding it with one hand isn't painful, and operating it is convenient and ergonomic. It does, however, feel a bit cramped if you're watching a game of football on it at home, but can't turn on the TV because everyone else has slept. The 10.9-inch display of the new generation iPad Air is perfect for this.Design and ergonomics: The best part of the iPad Mini 6Apple's claim of an 'all screen' design is a bit of a stretch as far as all-screen designs are concerned, for the 8.3-inch Liquid Retina panel of the iPad Mini 6 is flanked by thick but impressively even bezels. The new generation design makes it look modern, and the circular home button that's still on Apple's 9th generation iPad and 2nd generation iPhone SE is replaced by the power button that's at the top of the left edge, or to the right of the top edge - depending on how you're holding it. This also has Touch ID integrated into it.Apple iPad Mini 6 review: The new generation iPad Mini 6 looks in line with Apple's updated tablet design language, and feels premium. (Image: Shouvik Das/News18.com)The iPad Mini 6 is as smart and sleek as any other Apple hardware design available today, and its largely minimalistic approach is classy and mostly well thought out. Touch ID is easy to reach in both landscape and portrait orientations, and the magnetic attachment of the 2nd generation Apple Pencil happens neatly. Contrary to my expectations, it does not distract you when you're watching content on the screen, and its magnetic attachment is just strong enough to make sure that it does not get detached too easily.As far as ergonomics go, the iPad Mini 6 is mostly as ideal as you can hope for tablets to be. The volume button placement could have been better at the top (when it landscape orientation), but there's no space for it. The upper edge is taken up by the Pencil, the lower edge latches on to the folio cover, and the other two sides house four speakers in stereo configuration. All things considered, this is as neat a design as you could ask for.Display and UX: More Pro than Mini, minus a few iPadOS hiccupsI don't agree that the iPad Mini 6 has too small a display for a tablet, barring a few moments. Even compared to the largest smartphones, the iPad Mini 6's display is a good 1.5 inches larger, diagonally. This difference, between a large phone and this smallest iPad, is enough to be visible in terms of streaming shows, playing games, editing movies, writing and reading.Taking an approximate distance of 20 inches between your eyes and the point where you'd hold a screen when seated upright, the iPad Mini 6 covers a little over 85 percent of your area of direct vision. It does not break into peripheral vision, which ensures that you move your eyes less as you scan the display in landscape orientation. As avid readers would tell you, this makes a big difference. It could, however, have admittedly been a touch larger - which could've made it more versatile. A future iPad Mini may still offer a display size of around 9 inches, without compromising the compact form factor.Apple iPad Mini 6 review: The 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display is visually excellent, and for most use cases, the screen size is enough. (Image: Shouvik Das/News18.com)iPadOS, however, has room for improvements. The main home screen, as well as a number of apps, leave too much unused space, which makes the primary screen look sparse. Even the notifications menu does not look optimised, apart from being stretched out to meet the dimensions. The addition of widgets to iPadOS gives some visual contrast to icon sizes, but on overall terms, there are lots of blank areas on the display - more than what you'd expect from Apple. The Control Centre too is awkwardly tiny, and isn't the flagbearer of UX design.What I do like, however, is the convenience of the app dock - which gives you two-tap access to essential apps no matter which screen you're on. Two swipe-ups or a long swipe-up gesture opens the multitasking view, and while I'm not sure if the small window-based view is the most ergonomic, it is visually pleasant. Spotlight search is largely seamless too, and interestingly, also serves as the system's default calculator (to an extent).Apple iPad Mini 6 review: The iPadOS interface still has gaps to fill, especially with unused areas on the display. (Image: Shouvik Das/News18.com)As for the display quality, there is no complaining. You get even backlighting, excellent True Tone adjustment, fluid touch response, rich contrast and great colours. All of this makes tasks such as sketching and viewing content very pleasant. Visual artists will particularly love the richness and accuracy of the display's colours, and even the Quick Note feature is a good one for spontaneous usage. Purely on display terms, the iPad Mini 6 feels more like a mini iPad Pro, than an entry-level offering.The system keyboard is also of a good height, which means that if you need to work on the iPad Mini 6, the touch keyboard is well spaced out to type comfortably on. As a rule, touch inputs for a keyboard are never as ergonomic as a physical keyboard, but there is no Smart Keyboard for the Mini 6, and third party ones look too bulky - hence negating the point of the mini iPad. The touch keyboard actually works surprisingly well, and I was able to type out about 300 words while in the back seat of a car, without feeling annoyed.Performance: No stutters and great consistencyApple has put its latest A15 Bionic inside the iPad Mini 6, which should be enough to tell you that this tablet is powerful enough for most tasks. So far, it has proven to be a sharp and responsive tablet, without any noticeable hiccup as you switch between apps, set up multitasking views, and even load 4K video edits on an app such as InShot Pro. The iPad Mini 6 thus feels like a compact iPad Pro when it comes to performance, too.Apple iPad Mini 6 review: The performance is handled by the A15 Bionic, and has enough power for most use cases. (Image: Shouvik Das/News18.com)What makes the iPad Mini 6 great are small features that just work. The front camera, for instance, supports Center Stage - a feature that keeps you centred on the screen during video calls, and works on third party apps such as Zoom (and not just FaceTime). The quad stereo speakers are great for personal use, and once you plug in earphones and speakers, you get Dolby Atmos and Hi-Res Lossless audio. The built-in speakers are more than loud enough to use when you're alone, and its audio fidelity is far better than typical ones. You can even tweak the EQ to get some bass out of them.The iPad Mini 6 is also up to speed for heavier tasks such as gaming or multi-layer photo editing. There is consistently zero stutter, making it an excellent tablet to use. The iPad Mini 6 thus plugs a gap in the market for a compact device with a larger display than smartphones, and yet, not ungainly. What is to be seen, therefore, is if there are enough takers for it beyond the handful who still want screens to be small.Battery life: Adequate, but on the lesser endThe battery life of the iPad Mini 6 is one of its weaker notes. Apple states that on Wi-Fi, the tablet lasts for about 10 hours on a single charge with video streaming and browsing. For me, with the Apple Pencil attached to it, and about 3.5 hours of usage per day as a second display for music, live sports streaming, reading and browsing, it needs approximately one full charge every two days. Thankfully, Apple has shifted to USB-C with the iPad Mini 6 (a move that they should've done with the iPhone 13 series, too). There is a 20W USB-C charging adapter, and a two-way USB-C cable supplied in the box. The charger takes about 100 minutes to dole out a full charge.Cameras: Functional, when you need itAdmittedly, the rear camera of a tablet isn't the most important feature to have, and therefore, the single 12MP rear camera of the Apple iPad Mini 6 does not feel under-equipped. When you need it, the camera is adept at taking a good photograph, or a fairly smooth, short video. The front-facing 12MP ultra-wide camera generates a standard angle view by default, which crops the sensor. The real deal, however, is its actual 122-degree field of view, which lets it offer Center Stage with FaceTime and other video conferencing apps.Apple iPad Mini 6 review: The rear camera is adept when you need, but the front camera's Center Stage is highly convenient and is the real focus. (Image: Shouvik Das/News18.com)Once you get used to Center Stage, you'd realise that it is indeed handy. The panning to centre you on the screen is seamless, and the full HD video quality is more than adequate for all your usage needs. The front camera can shoot at 60fps too, hence keeping your footage smooth. If you must, even the rear camera offers 60fps videos at up to 4K, which is probably more than what you'd need from a tablet's camera.Verdict: The iPad to buyThere are very few gadgets that we use and find to be a near-perfect device to own and use, and the Apple iPad Mini 6 is one such. The display could have been a tad bigger, but for all intents and purposes, this screen size is big enough to give you an upgrade over your phone, and at the same time, small enough to keep things ergonomic. Its form factor is convenient, its design feels premium and modern, and it also has a flagship-grade display, a self-centering and ample firepower. It also has 5G, so if you get the cellular variant, you're future proofed as well.At Rs 46,900 starting price, the iPad Mini 6 is a lovely tablet to own. It's the right size in terms of portability if you travel frequently, and the same applies if you want a second, compact display to augment your main work machine on your desk. There is Pencil support for sketchers too (sold separately), and in our books, the entry-level, 64GB variant is the perfect balance in terms of value and features.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.","The iPad Mini (2021), now in its 6th generation, is a delightful gadget to own, and could have been entirely perfect with a bigger battery and Apple Smart Keyboard support.",
"All the way from Nepal by road, 127 quintals of shaligram shila (stone) have reached Ayodhya, where the much-awaited Ram temple is under construction. The centre of attraction these days, there is much curiosity on how the idol of Hindu deity Ram will look like.While the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust has not yet decided if shaligram will be used to carve out the idol, the priests conducted its puja as per Vedic rituals.Chief priest of Ram Janmabhoomi temple, Acharya Satyendra Das said shaligram shila is considered pious in Sanatan dharma. (Image: News18)But why have these stones, that may or may not be used to make Ram's idol, been brought all the way from Nepal? What is so special about this ancient stone?Residence of Hindu deity VishnuAccording to the chief priest of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple, Acharya Satyendra Das, shaligram shila is considered pious in Sanatan dharma. This is why it is found in every temple as it is believed that Vishnu resides in it. The shila was first found in Nepal's Gandaki river, which is considered sacred. According to religious beliefs, wherever this shila is kept, Vishnu's consort Lakshmi resides there as well. In almost every temple and math in the country, shaligram shila is used to carve out statues. According to beliefs, this stone is not consecrated. Unlike other stones, it is where Vishnu is considered to reside. This shila is also related to Tulsi, which is why it is worshipped across temples.Read all the Latest India News here","While the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust has not yet decided if shaligram shila will be used to carve out Ram's idol, the priests conducted its puja as per Vedic rituals","While the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust has not yet decided if shaligram will be used to carve out the idol, the priests conducted its puja as per Vedic rituals."
"Apple is all set to embark on what most certainly has to be the biggest refresh for the Mac computing device line-up in many years. And it coincides with the end of Apple and Intel's partnership that has seen off the test of time for a solid 15 years. As we head into tonight's the 'One More Thing' Apple Event, it really isn't hard to imagine that on the menu will be the much-awaited new Apple Mac computing devices, powered by Apple's own processors and graphics. There had been whispers about this impending switch since the beginning of the year (you know, the internet can be quite gossipy) and Apple eventually confirmed the switch at the Worldwide Developers Conference over the summer. Multiple advantages of that, including performance boosts, a closer knit hardware and software ecosystem and also a potential widening of the price band, particularly on the lower side. And that further makes one wonder—which Macs get the Apple Silicon first?First and foremost, it is important to understand that Apple and Intel's long-standing partnership doesn't come to an end today. It doesn't come to an end here and now, or on November 10. This is supposed to be a 2-year transition period, allowing Apple a 24-month window to make the switch for all Mac computing device lines. Yes, you will continue to see new Apple MacBook and Apple iMac updates for at least the next 12 months or so, still running Intel processors. As existing consumers, you need not worry at all about this possible change. Your Macs will continue to get all the updates and support for the next few years, without any change. If you are looking to buy a Mac device now, and the one you have shortlisted happens to be an Intel processor powered one, you can be assured there isn't a hidden kill-switch that'll usher in the end of the machine one fine morning. It won't. Even if Apple and Intel eventually stop making new computing devices together, your Macs will continue to run as they always have.The Apple Silicon hardware is a very important part of the puzzle for Apple. The same puzzle, the same pursuit to have the same experiential control over the hardware and the software, which has worked wonders for the iPhone line-up over the years. It is expected that the new chip will be very similar to the A14 Bionic that powered the latest iPhone 12 line-up as well as the new Apple iPad Air. With their own processor and graphics, Apple will have complete control over the melding of the hardware, macOS and apps running on the platform, to eke out better performance and a slicker experience. Surely, one of the complaints that Apple must have had with Intel over the past few years would have been that the performance increments on an annual basis just aren't big enough.Apple has been designing chips for its products for years now. With serious performance, machine learning and graphics improvements in every generation. The iPad, the iPhone, HomePod, Apple TV, Apple Watch and even that silicon intelligence in the AirPods and the T2 security chip that is now part of the MacBook line-up. Yes, there will always be risks when shifting from the Intel chips to Apple Silicon, but it isn't entirely unchartered territory for Apple. As it may have been for some other brands.Then there is the cross platform play that Apple wants to leverage. During the WWDC keynote this summer, Apple confirmed that the custom-chips for the Macs will be able to run iPhone and iPad apps too. That will be massive. The underlying architecture of Apple's A12Z chip (we did not have the A14 Bionic till then) also powers the 2020 versions of the iPad Pro 12.9 and the iPad Pro 11, that has been shipped with the Developer Transition Kit. That included a Mac Mini with 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD with the macOS Big Sur developer beta, and the chips that power the iPhone and the iPad remains the same.Apple's custom chips will have their own designed graphics and storage controllers as well. During the WWDC keynote, Apple demoed the power of the upcoming custom-chip powered Macs by also showing off the Monument Valley 2, Calm, and the Fender Play apps. We are finally entering the uniform world that Apple had envisioned with apps running seamlessly across all their platforms. Buy an app on an iPhone, use it on the iPad and macOS as well. That's the world we are getting ever closer to.This coming together of macOS with iOS and iPadOS started last year with macOS 10.15 Catalina and the Catalyst apps that support Apple's UIKit software framework used for the iPhone and iPad apps. It may have been a bit more complicated then, but the change in the beating heart that is the silicon, just streamlines the attempts at uniformity further. If you look at the visual changes that Apple showed off with the upcoming macOS Big Sur, there seems to be a considerable resemblance to the iOS and iPadOS apps for the same—Safari, Messages and Photos, for instance.So, which Macs will get the first bite of the new silicon? If we are to look at the candidates, it isn't a simple pick. Unless there is going to be a significant shortening of the update cycle for this year, for some Mac devices. The Apple MacBook Pro 13 has already received the 2020 refresh with the 10th generation Intel Core processors. So has the MacBook Air, around the same time. The iMac 21.5-inch as well as the iMac 27-inch have also been refreshed in the second half of 2020. That pretty well just leaves the Apple MacBook Pro 16 which is yet to get the 2020 refresh. Could we see the flagship MacBook Pro usher in the Apple Silicon era? It could be a rather solid statement if Apple was to do that. My bets are solidly behind the largest MacBook Pro ushering in the new era for Apple Silicon. What could be better than the flagship MacBook leading the line, as the Macs drive down a new path. Could it also be the Mac Pro that gets the Apple Silicon? It is believed that Apple is working on a redesigned Mac Pro. Yet, it is unlikely that a Mac Pro would be the only Mac to get the Apple Silicon. Well, there has been chatter about the return of the 12-inch Apple MacBook. The MacBook Air and the iPad Pro 12.9 may have something to say about that. And if that were to happen, we could have an even more affordable MacBook option.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here","Mind you, Apple isn't new to the game of making processors too. And with greater control over the Mac hardware, it wants to leverage the cross platform capabilities for macOS alongside iOS and iPadOS. That helps consumers, developers and further knits the three ecosystems together.",

A whole bunch of new phones are also expected to launch at the Mobile World Congress 2019 next month. However, a lot of smartphones have already been confirmed by companies that are going to launch in soon in India. Here is a list of smartphones expected to launch in India soon. Redmi Note 7: Xiaomi has confirmed the launch of Redmi Note 7 in India, which is going to happen on February 28. In terms of other specifications, the handset features a 6.3-inch full-HD+ (2340x1080 pixels) LTPS display with 19.5:9 aspect ratio, 450 nits brightness, 84 percent NTSC colour gamut, Corning Gorilla Glass 5, and 2.5D curved glass protection. It runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 octa-core SoC paired with 3GB, 4GB, and 6GB RAM options along with 32GB and 64GB storage options. At the back, there is a dual camera setup with a 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 sensor with f/1.8 aperture and a 5-megapixel sensor. The company claims that the experience is elevated thanks to AI-backed software features. At the front, there is a 13-megapixel selfie camera. Other features include a 4,000mAh battery with Quick Charge 4 support, USB Type-C port, 3.5mm audio jack, 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and MIUI 9 based on Android Oreo. Samsung Galaxy M30: Samsung is all set to launch the first triple camera smartphone under the Galaxy M series of smartphones. The company has officially confirmed that the Samsung Galaxy M30 will launch on the 27th of February. Samsung will bring Super-Amoled Infinity V display to 'M30', making it a power-packed offering for young millennials. Powered by latest Exynos 7904 processor, Galaxy 'M30' comes with 4GB RAM-64GB internal memory variant. The device is also likely to have a 6GB-128GB variant. Samsung India in January launched Galaxy 'M20' and 'M10' smartphones at a starting price of Rs 10,990 and Rs 7,990, respectively, to take on Xiaomi's budget ""Redmi"" series in the country. The Samsung Galaxy M30 will have a triple camera setup on the back with 13-megapixel sensor, 5-megapixel super wide angle lens, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. On the front, the device will have a 16-megapixel selfie camera with support for 1080p video recording and face unlock. The device is expected to come with a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution, protected by 2.5D curved tempered glass. Other features of the Samsung Galaxy M30 are expected to include a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, face unlock, USB Type-C support, 3.5mm audio jack and a 5000mAh battery. Oppo F11 Pro: Oppo has recently revealed that it'll soon unveil the Oppo F11 Pro in India. The successor to the F9 Pro will equip a dual rear camera at the back with a 48-megapixel main lens which will be the first time in Oppo's history. This sensor could possibly be Sony's IMX586 CMOS sensor which was introduced last year. Oppo says the 48-megapixel camera on the F11 Pro will offer a 'high-definition camera with impressive photo quality and viewing experience'. The camera will also equip a Super Night Mode. It recently got certifications in Indonesia and Thailand with a model number of CPH1969. OPPO mentions the words 'Brilliant Portrait' that allude to the fact that the 48-megapixel cam should have improved low-light capabilities facilitated by either the Samsung ISOCELL GM1 or Sony IMX586 sensor. Other rumored specs include a 6.5-inch IPS LCD touchscreen with 2340 x 1080 resolution, the Snapdragon 855 SoC with Adreno 640 GPU, 32 MP selfie cam with HDR features, 6 GB of RAM and 64 / 128 GB storage, plus Android 9.0. Samsung Galaxy M50: Alleged renders of the Galaxy A50 have emerged along with details of the upcoming handset. Posted by PriceKart.com, the renders reveal that looks similar to the upcoming Galaxy M30. The renders show a handset with a vertically-aligned triple camera setup at the back with an LED flash unit. At the front, there is a water-drop styled notch similar to the one we have seen on the Galaxy M10 and M20. To top it off, the renders also suggest that the handset will have an in-display fingerprint scanner. In the camera department, the renders say that the front camera will feature a 25-megapixel sensor while the triple camera on the back will feature a primary 25-megapixel sensor, a 5-megapixel sensor for depth mapping and an 8-megapixel camera with an ultra-wide lens. The handset is expected to feature a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with full-HD+ resolution and 19.5:9 aspect ratio. On the inside, expect an Exynos 9610 processor with up to 6GB RAM + 128GB internal storage and a 4,000mAh battery to provide the juice. Realme 3: Realme was speculated to launch a new smartphone sometime in the first quarter of the year. Going by the previous reports, we can expect the Realme 3 to arrive with a 48-megapixel rear camera similar to the Redmi Note 7. This camera sensor might use the pixel binning technology to render 48-megapixel output as seen in the recently launched smartphones from other brands. Also, as it is an upgrade to the Realme 2, we can expect it to feature an improved set of features and specifications as its prequel. As announced by the company, we can either expect it to be launched with Android Pie out of the box.","Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, Samsung Galaxy M30, Samsung Galaxy M50, Realme 3, Oppo R11 Pro smartphones are expected to launch in India soon.",
"Few films have raised a storm as strong as The Kashmir Files in recent times. A film made nearly thirty years after the original events that unfolded in Kashmir since 1989 has gained attention of everyone alike for its provocative, bold and in your face portrayal of the plight of Kashmiri Hindus. India's youngsters have been shocked by the film with many resorting to the Internet to check if the gory details are indeed true, only to learn that all this took place with real people in real time in the place known as heaven on earth — Kashmir.While we have a large section of people who want to know and understand how an entire community was tortured, raped and threatened to leave the Valley because of their religion with just three choices facing them — Ralib, Galib, Chalib (Convert, Die or Leave) — we have a huge army of Left-Islamists who are even going to the extent of calling this film a piece of propaganda. The latest one to do this is an Israeli filmmaker, Nadav Lapid who used the platform of IFFI, a film festival organised by the government of India to call this movie a 'vulgar propaganda'.The ambassador of Israel to India immediately got into a firefighting mode by posting a Twitter thread slamming Lapid's views but the filmmaker remained unapologetic. He is rather proud of calling a film made on the plight of Kashmiri Hindus as propagandistic. In his defence, he said that the film justifies the policy of the Indian government in Kashmir and has 'fascist features'. This is the first time in the history of a genocide being documented that a film is being called fascist!What exactly are the compulsions of Nadav Lapid and his fellow leftists and Islamists to declare this film as propaganda? Well, the Kashmir conflict is a long drawn one where this tribe of Left-Islamists masquerading as intellectuals typically picks the Indian state as the perpetrator and the Muslim-majority population of Kashmir as the victim. In their hustle to call the Indian state as fascist and a budding Hindutva project, they forget that the Valley had a Muslim majority before 1989 as well and the state's iron-fisted response was to the militancy that arose in Kashmir and not to the average Kashmiri people. The militancy which actually was an elaborate terror conspiracy made the Kashmiri Hindus its first victim. The Islamists with clear logistical support from the Pakistani deep state terrorised an entire population that was living in Kashmir for many centuries and forced them to leave the Valley.The situation on ground for the Hindu population in Kashmir is still terrible in 2022 with targeted killings taking place to prevent these people from settling down in the valley. Despite the ordeal faced by the Kashmiri Hindus constituting the classic definition of a genocide, unfortunately it has not been termed as such officially. There hasn't been a single commission of inquiry to look into the event. What's worse is that globally every organisation and forum that matters has taken into account the separatists' narrative in building their 'reports' where again the Muslim population is the victim and the Indian state is their culprit. In this globally-dominant narrative, a film that portrays the mere reality of what happened to Girija Tickoo and many others at the hands of Islamists is obviously going to cause a backlash. Films that paint Indian state as the villain are welcome but not the ones that call out the Islamist designs.However, a thought worth pondering is that what sort of a society are we becoming where the plight of Kashmiri Hindus is being called a propaganda by the Left-Islamists but the 'intellectuals' are completely alright with the bastardisation of the narrative? Aren't some facts in our civilised world beyond the divides of Left and Right? A comparable fact is the Holocaust of Jews, denial of which is punishable in more than 16 countries world over. One will immediately face jail-time if they take a 'creative liberty' in denying the Holocaust and glorifying the Nazis. But not in the case of Kashmiri Hindus whose genocide can be denied and their culprits including the terrorists can be glorified as 'freedom fighters'.What Nadav Lapid did will seal his status as someone who spoke truth to power in the leftist circles, but truth is that his statement has murdered the Kashmiri Hindus all over again.The author is a PhD in International Relations from the Department of International Relations, South Asian University.

"In this strange world driven by narratives, one narrative that has become a national mainstay and even internationalised to a great extent is that Muslims are unsafe in India, today. Interestingly, it all started with the victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2014 elections and the 2019 elections after that. But now, no matter how hard the facts are that Muslims have emerged as the largest beneficiaries of the Modi government schemes, the sheer power of anecdotes overrules it. In such a scenario, one key fact that has been missed by all of us is how a section of Muslims is being disenfranchised systematically in our country by their co-religionists.India is constitutionally a secular-liberal polity that provides freedom of religion for all, but the way Ahmadiyya, a particular sect of Islam, is being threatened with stripping off their religious identity by people of their own community has created an interesting paradox last week. In the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, the Ahmadiyya community has approached the Central government to intervene against a case of their exclusion from the larger Muslim community. This follows a resolution passed by the Andhra Pradesh Waqf Board in February declaring them as 'Non-Muslims' or 'Kafirs'.'Kafir' is a derogatory term that is often used by Muslims against those people, including Hindus, who don't embrace Islam. The opposite of Kafir is Momin or someone who is a believer.Ahmadiyya Muslims are a sub-sect of the Sunni Muslims who originated in the 19th century in undivided Punjab, India. Its founder was Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, a reformist who wanted Islam to adapt in tune with modern times and assume a more liberal tone and tenor. He stressed on the role of Islam as a matter of personal faith and took an apologetic stand against 'jihad' which is using violence to spread Islam or for political motives. The Ahmadiyya sect as founded by him became a key example of the reformist movement in the Indian subcontinent in the late 19th century, a time when even Hinduism was also witnessing revivalist and reformist movements of its own, including the Arya Samaj and the Brahmo Samaj movements. But ironically, unlike the Hindus who received the reformist movements positively, Ahmadiyyas have become a major irritant for orthodox Muslims across the world.The worst example of their persecution is present in Pakistan which has outlawed them from claiming their Muslim identity. They don't have a legal status in the country today and instances of their social persecution are just too many. In fact, Pakistan has also disowned the first person to ever win a Nobel Prize from the country for being a person from the Ahmadi community. Dr Abdus Salam, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 died unrecognised, uncelebrated and outlawed in Pakistan where he was born in the undivided Punjab in 1926. Tragically, the term 'Muslim' has been painted white to hide this reference on his tomb in Pakistan, despite Dr Salam playing a huge role in setting up key institutions such as Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission and the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant.In India, Ahmadiyyas have enjoyed much more equal treatment and the right to be called a Muslim, all thanks to the legal status that is accorded to them under Indian Law. Many Ahmadis have risen to positions of prominence including the celebrated scientist, Dr Hafiz Saleh Muhammad Alladin who was awarded by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and served as an educational advisor to India's ex-President, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam.Although India continues to protect their rights becoming a curious exception in a world where they are persecuted through various means, socially, they still remain an ostracised community. They don't have representation on the All India Muslim Personal Law Board even today. Not just this, their events are regularly called-off and stones are pelted by miscreants inside their mosque as a mark of protest against their reformatory zeal.Some of them even recall how they were banned from using public taps or shopping at common shops meant for other sects of Muslims. This social boycott of the Ahmadi community makes the decision of the Andhra Waqf Board to call them Kafir as just another move to deny them their rights. It is not the first time though. In 2012 also, a similar resolution was passed in undivided Andhra, a matter which is still pending in the court.India has been a cradle for multiple religions with its Constitution providing equal rights to each. In the same sentiment, the Modi government has also taken the Waqf board to task by telling them that no one has the authority to declare Ahmadiyyas as non-Muslims. But as always happens, this section of Muslims will still witness ostracisation socially, even as a fake narrative on India being intolerant towards its minorities will make global headlines.The author is a PhD in International Relations from the Department of International Relations, South Asian University.

"The dengue virus is more lethal in higher temperatures, resulting in aggressive disease, bleeding, drop in platelet count and even death. A new study supported by the department of biotechnology and Indian Council of Medical Research was conducted to analyse the effect of temperature in altering the virus virulence. Several authors, including Institute of Advanced Virology (IAV) director Easwaran Sreekumar, conducted the study. 'The factors that drive dengue virus evolution and selection of virulent variants are not yet clear,' said the study published in 'The FASEB Journal' on June 30.Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) is a peer-reviewed journal, which publishes research covering biology and biomedical sciences.The study explains that 'higher environmental temperature shortens DENV (dengue virus) extrinsic incubation period in mosquitoes, increases human transmission, and plays a critical role in outbreak dynamics'. Authors found that DENV cultured at a higher temperature in C6/36 mosquito cells was significantly more virulent than the virus grown at a lower temperature.In a mouse model, the study found that the virulent strain induced enhanced viremia (presence of viruses in the blood) and aggressive disease within a short course of time, haemorrhaging, severe vascular permeability, and death. 'Higher inflammatory cytokine response, thrombocytopenia and severe histopathological changes in vital organs such as the heart, liver, and kidney were hallmarks of the disease,' the study stated.The strain of the virus in lower-temperature areas was found to be different from the strain in higher-temperature areas. 'Whole genome comparison with a lower temperature passaged strain identified key genomic changes in the structural protein-coding regions as well as in the 3′UTR of the viral genome,' it stated.The study concluded: 'Our results show that virulence-enhancing genetic changes could occur in the dengue virus genome under enhanced growth temperature conditions in mosquito cells.'","The new study - conducted by several authors, including director of Institute of Advanced Virology - found that the strain of dengue virus in lower-temperature areas was different than that in higher-temperature areas","'The factors that drive dengue virus evolution and selection of virulent variants are not yet clear,' said the study published in 'The FASEB Journal' on June 30."
"After the long summer break, schools in Tamil Nadu have reopened for Classes 6 to 12 on Monday. The School Education Department delayed the reopening of schools earlier this month because of the heat and rising temperatures across the state. The revised timetable states that Classes 6 to 12 have begun, while Classes 1 and 5 will resume on June 14.To protect students from the extreme heat in different parts of the state, Chief Minister M. K. Stalin's directive led to the decision of pushing back the reopening date. Meanwhile, Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, the Minister of School Education of Tamil Nadu emphasised the necessity of maintaining student safety amidst the rising temperature.Initially, schools were supposed to reopen on June 7. The School Education Department had to change the schedule, though, due to worries about the weather and high temperatures. Classes 1 to 5 were originally scheduled to resume on June 5, with classes 6 to 12 starting on June 1.Following the recent declaration, chief educational authorities in districts like Chennai and Chengalpattu issued circulars directing all schools, whether public, aided, or private, to abide by the announced reopening dates. Strict mechanisms were put in place to ensure compliance and district-level officials were in charge of keeping an eye on the issue and taking appropriate action.Schools in the Chengalpattu district were specifically told not to hold senior school special classes before the scheduled reopening dates, and any infractions would result in departmental repercussions, according to reports. The government of Tamil Nadu said that it is dedicated to putting students' needs first and upholding a safe learning environment despite adverse weather circumstances when schools resume operations there.Doctors have urged people to take precautions as schools get ready to welcome students so that they can stay safe in the heat. 'Children should not be exposed to direct sunlight, and it will help if schools schedule PT periods at the end of the day, avoiding 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. It is important that students are seated in well-ventilated classrooms that aren't very crowded,' Rema Chandramohan, Director, Institute of Child Health said as per The Hindu.",CM M.

"Oppo is said to be working on a premium smartphone that is expected to succeed the Oppo Find X, which was introduced towards the end of 2018. The new handset, which is being called the Find X2 by a reputable source on Weibo, will be coming with some exciting specifications as per the leaked information. According to a report, the phone is likely to come with a 6.5-inch display curved OLED panel, with a 3168x1440 pixel resolution and will also support 120Hz refresh rate. Furthermore, it is said that the user of the phone will have an option to choose between FHD+ and QHD+ resolution and 60Hz or 120Hz refresh rate in any combination they like. It is also claimed that it is apparently possible to have QHD+ at 120Hz. Apart from that, the report states that it is a possibility that the phone might come powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 and will also support 5G connectivity. If speculations are to be believed, then the upcoming phone might also house a camera image sensor with 'omnidirectional' autofocus. Even though it is not confirmed, but there are rumours that the phone might also support 50W wireless charging, which should offer similar charging speeds as the Realme X2 Pro.","The Oppo Find X2 will most likely support 5G connectivity, 50W wireless charging and be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865.","According to a report, the phone is likely to come with a 6.5-inch display curved OLED panel, with a 3168x 1440 pixel resolution and will also support 120Hz refresh rate."

"Going by what's on record, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's two-day visit to Sri Lanka did not generate any additional cause for concern, especially for the Indian neighbour. Unlike in the past, the local media too played it down through and through. A day after his visit, many of Colombo's English language newspapers, euphemistically referred as the 'national media', instead, played up how the crippling forex crisis had hit domestic electricity supply too hard, dependent that the nation is on imported oil and coal for burning its thermal power stations.According to early media reports, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa urged the visitor and his team for a restructuring of the monies that the island nation owes to them. It's a pragmatic request even without the forex crisis, given the global COVID conditions of the past year and more. Wang Yi also met Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is the non-executive head acting under the President, his brother. With the latter, the visitor mostly discussed future cooperation efforts, for which decisions lay with the President and the Cabinet as a whole.In sum, Wang Yi's visit was uneventful, one way or the other—at least until one or more skeletons tumble out of the cupboard.Spirit of R-R PactDuring Wang Yi's Colombo visit, the two sides also discussed the path covered together over the last 65 years of diplomatic cooperation. Significantly, bilateral economic cooperation had commenced six years earlier in 1951-52, with the two sides signing the 'Rice for Rubber Pact' and acting on it immediately in the wake of food crisis in Sri Lanka, then Ceylon.Under the scheme, Mao's China, still settling down to business after taking over power in 1949, supplied rice to drought-hit Ceylon at lower-than-market prices and purchased rubber, the only exportable commodity of the island-nation at the time, at prices higher than international prices. It should have shown global adversaries of the fledgling communist nation how deep and far-sighted the new masters were. Some of China's much-praised strategic thinking and economic leveraging ideas may have begun there.India, in comparison, was itself reeling under economic pressures flowing from accompanying drought years and the post-Independence, post-Partition social and developmental woes. It did not have rice to offer to Ceylon. While Sri Lankans do not complain about India of those days, they definitely have not forgotten China's 'grace and generosity', making it as dependable an ally as good-neighbourly India.As some of Sri Lanka's strategic thinkers point out, at the time of the R-R Pact, China did not have any global ambitions, its place even in the immediate Asian context was unknown, so was the future of communist China. So, the argument goes, there was no strategic intent in what China did for their nation at the time. It was, plain and simple, humanitarian assistance, of which the rest of the world began hearing a lot in later years.Jobless GrowthIt is now taken for granted in Colombo that China would respond positively to President Gotabaya's request for debt restructuring. Beijing has been doing so for other borrower-nations since the COVID pandemic began crippling their economies too. Hence the question arises if the two sides discussed medium- and long-term economic cooperation plans that could pull Sri Lankan economy out of the mess that it finds itself in. For India and the world, the price that Colombo will be expected to pay and will be willing to pay for China's eleventh-hour assistance would be of as much interest and concern as the size of further Chinese assistance, if any. Friends of Sri Lanka, other than China, will also be interested in knowing where that money would be going and how it would be spent.The reasons are not far to seek. Through the past decade, the massive Chinese debt investment did not create a single job for a Sri Lankan, nor did it put money in the pocket of any Sri Lankan entrepreneur or supplier (barring politicians, if any). The Chinese brought their men and material to execute their work, no questions asked, no murmur of protests. If only the politicians, including the eternal Opposition in the Left-leaning Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), had protested as much as they had done on other occasions, especially when it came to Indian, US and other investments, they could have saved their nation from this sad day. People standing in long queues for (imported) milk powder in what essentially is an agrarian economy would not have to hoot at President Gotabaya as his motorcade passed the point in capital Colombo, if only they had protested the Chinese investments. Independent of the white-elephant Chinese projects, there was always the element of jobless growth even when there was growth, induced by massive Chinese credit, especially under the government of then President Mahinda Rajpaksa (2005-2015). Much of the present crisis in economic terms could be explained thus. Though China is the fourth largest lender/investor in Sri Lanka, after Japan, the concept of not creating jobs for the locals and not putting money in their pockets has dried up those pockets during this pandemic even as creditors stand in long queues, demanding repayment when due.Indian IronyIn contrast, every thing Indian in terms of aid and assistance faces instant protest. Though India signed its first Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Sri Lanka in the late '90s, upgrading it at the appropriate time has remained an uphill task. The previous Rajapaksa era initialled the MoU for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) after bilateral negotiations for years, but just ahead of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's Sri Lanka visit in 2008, public protesters mysteriously appeared on the Colombo streets, delaying it indefinitely.Successor Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Sri Lanka dumped CEPA in 2015, but promised anther agreement in its place. But till he left power in 2019, his government was negotiating what came to be known as ETCA, or Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA). It is yet another forgotten page in bilateral economic relations. As Prime Minister, Ranil piloted the conversion of Hambantota construction contract, inherited from the Mahinda regime, into a leasehold in China's favour. Pre-poll 2015, he unilaterally declared that he would stop China-funded Colombo Port City (CPC), as if to please the Indian neighbour and also his US-led western allies. After coming to power, when the current Gotabaya regime piloted the CPC management bill in Parliament last year, Ranil's party and the breakaway Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) reiterated that they were all for the project, and had problems only with Gotabaya's scheme.Now comes the most recent of them all. In the week that China's Wang Yi was visiting Colombo, India and Sri Lanka signed the much-delayed agreement on cooperative usage of the Second World War vintage oil tank farms in eastern Trincomalee. Unlike what Colombo promised to India's Adani Group on handing over controlling stakes in the Western Container Terminal (WCT) in the Colombo Port, on the Trinco deal, they are talking about Sri Lanka retaining the controlling 51:49 stakes. Needless to refer to the intervening ECT deal, for which the Wickremesinghe government signed only an MoU with India and Japan and which the present Gotabaya regime dumped, citing (manufactured?) protests by labour and Buddhist monks. Trade unions had protested some time back when the Trinco deal was on the anvil. A Buddhist organisation, the Bhikkhu Front, has since moved the Supreme Court, challenging the Trinco deal. In this context, it remains to be seen how the Trinco deal takes shape on the ground, especially after the Indian funding to tide over the immediate forex needs of Sri Lanka has met its purpose—and has dried up, too. Will there be a revival of trade union protests, or a dis-spirited government defence of the deal in the Supreme Court, or both—whether or not these involve China, as is often suspected in India but need not always be the case—such a course would make Beijing happy, all the same.The writer is Distinguished Fellow and Head-Chennai Initiative, Observer Research Foundation, the multi-disciplinary Indian public-policy think-tank, headquartered in New Delhi.

"Kolkata: A woman from Kolkata is playing a crucial role in the Oxford University team trying to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, which could potentially end the pandemic. Chandra Datta, 34, who lives in Oxford, is working as a quality assurance manager at the university facility manufacturing the anti-viral vector vaccine — ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 — which started human trials last week. Her parents, 65-year-old Samir Kanti and 58-year-old Kaberi Datta, live in Kolkata's Golf Garden area. While they are proud of their only daughter working as one of the main scientists working on the vaccine's development, they are also worried since the death toll and new cases in the United Kingdom has only continued to rise. ""My daughter has always been ambitious and intelligent. The way the coronavirus is spreading, I was extremely tense about her wellbeing,"" said the mother Chandra went to Gokhale Memorial Girls' School and has a B.Tech in engineering and biotechnology from the Heritage Institute of Technology. She moved to the UK in 2009 to study for an M.Sc in bioscience (biotechnology) at Leeds University. She then worked in several roles before last year landing her plum job at Oxford where she works at its Cinical Bio-manufacturing Facility, which manufactures viral vector vaccines for early-phase clinical trials all over the world and is currently testing the COVID-19 vaccine developed at the Jenner Institute.

"iOS 16 is promising a lot of nifty features and it seems Apple has more tricks up its sleeves for iPhone users this year. According to new reports, iOS 16 will let you log into different sites without having to go through the Captcha login system. In this, you have to identify the right images that match the selection in order to prove that you are not a robot. So, instead of the Captcha logins, Apple is bringing Private Access Token on iOS 16 for iPhone users. Apple had a session at the WWDC 2022 earlier this month titled Replace CAPTCHA's with Private Access Token. Apple has reportedly explained the use of these tokens to its developers. It says that tokens will help the apps identify the HTTP request coming from humans and the right device allotted to the user. This feature promises better safety for the apps, and the developers get authenticated logins without using CAPTCHA. Also Read: Telegram Premium Launched: Everything You Get For A Rs 390 Telegram SubscriptionApple uses its closed device ecosystem to make the new tokens work. The logins happen through the Apple ID and your tokens are designed around cryptography which makes it hard to decrypt and these are stored securely on your cloud ID. Apple has already started working with companies like Fastly and services such as Cloudflare. Apple is likely to offer the new login system through the first set of iOS 16, iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura betas that are rolling out next month for users.

"Did you know, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has a new smartphone app that lets you select channels you want to see on your Cable TV or direct to home (DTH) connection and attempts to optimize the subscription costs for you. This way, you can save some money on your monthly TV subscription bills, and it guides you to the best possible ala-carte and channel bouquet options depending on the channels you have selected to watch. This app is meant to be a unifying experience that covers multiple MSO cable TV and DTH operators, including Tata Sky, Airtel Digital TV, DishTV, D2h, Hathway Digital, Siti Networks, Asianet and InDigital. It is expected that more Cable TV operators will be added to this list, in the coming weeks and months. The TRAI Channel Selector app is now available on the Google Play Store for Android phones and the App Store for the Apple iPhone and is free to download. You start by selecting your cable or DTH operator, and then validate your subscription by punching in the subscription ID and the registered mobile number. It has to be an active subscription else you'll not be able to go to the next step. You get an OTP at this stage to verify that it is actually you who wants to modify your cable TV and DTH channel packs. You get a snapshot of the current subscription, the channels, the bouquets and the cost. You can add more channels as desired from the list of channels that your Cable TV or DTH operator offers at that time. At this point, if there are any optimizations that you can avail—such as perhaps going for a bouquet instead of ala-carte channels at the same or lower cost—are offered up here. It was early last year that TRAI had implemented the new tariff order which dictated the pricing of channels and bouquets on cable TV and DTH services. The underlying theme since then has been that a lot of users have complained about their subscription costs going up. Incidentally, TRAI had a version of the channel selector running on the website since early last year. At this time, most DTH companies and cable TV service providers offer their own apps which allow similar functionality as well—selecting channels, adding or dropping channels and bouquets and optimizing subscription costs based on selected channels. It was in August last year that TRAI asked all Distributed Platform Operators (DPOs) to share the APIs with them for this app. TRAI insists that users face difficulties when using the portals or apps of individual operators while managing their subscription.",The TRAI Channel Selector app is free to download from the Google Play Store for Android phones and the App Store for the Apple iPhone.,

"Just as Prime Minister Modi wrapped his US tour and headed to Egypt, his second state visit this month, Ilhan Omar is back in the news and how. Omar, who is a member of the US House of Representatives, is moving a resolution against India condemning its human rights record and treatment of minorities that include Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and interestingly Jews as well. This is pretty ironic for a representative who has been seated out from the foreign affairs committee of the Congress over her anti-Semitic remarks targeting the Jews. In fact, unlike what Ilhan Omar is claiming in the resolution to tarnish India's image, India has always been one of the safest places for Jews the world over. It has a civilisational history of giving refuge to the Jewish community when they were facing persecution in their own native lands. But Omar clearly isn't someone who gives credence to facts over propaganda.In the resolution, she has called on the Secretary of State to designate India as a 'Country of Particular Concern' in the next annual report of the US International Religious Freedom Commission. India has been already mentioned as a country of particular concern for the last four years in the USIRF annual report. But Omar is unrelenting in her pursuit of labelling India as a country that doesn't accord its minorities their due rights. This is not the first time that she has moved a resolution against India at the US Congress. In 2022 also, she had moved a resolution targeting India over the treatment of minorities. She also boycotted Prime Minister Modi's joint address to the US Congress last week, joined by fellow democrats Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Ideally, a Muslim politician moving a resolution in the legislative body of a powerful democracy must send India into serious introspection mode but the truth is Ilhan Omar is no well-meaning politician who indeed has the best interests of India's minorities in her heart. She is an Islamist who has been called out on multiple occasions for pandering to radical Islamist forces. In 2020, Qasem Soleimani, a powerful Iranian General was killed in a drone strike by the United States in Iraq. Soleimani was responsible for many American deaths and was even designated as a foreign terrorist by the US. But instead of supporting the government in his elimination, she showed solidarity with him going against the interest of her own country. This reaction by her was in complete contrast to how she had responded to the 9/11 attacks where she famously remarked that 'some people did something' and mocked the victims of the brutal terror incident.Also unmissable is her stand on the Iranian anti-hijab protest. When a large number of women in Iran had taken to the streets to reclaim their freedom, Omar, who is a habitual victim card player over her identity as a Muslim woman, did not even support them. In fact, she sided with the Iranian regime's brutal crackdown by comparing it with how the police in the US has to maintain public order.Omar's love for the Islamists is no secret as she has openly indulged leaders such as Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a man who has firmly pushed the country away from a secular polity towards the path of a deeply rooted Islamisation. In 2022, she paid a visit to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This was another of her usual tricks to use Islamophobia as a trope to hide the crimes of the Islamists. Expectedly, she raised the issue of how the Indian state is violating human rights without even recognising the horror of Islamic terrorism that has plagued Kashmir. Her antics led the US government to distance itself from the visit and issue a clarification that it was a private trip. There were multiple allegations against her that the trip was funded by a Pakistani businessman who had also arranged her meeting with Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister of the country.Ilhan's intention in raising the false bogey of ill-treatment of minorities in India reflects her ambition to position herself as a crusader against Islamophobia. But her record on real issues of Muslims and the lack of empathy shown by her in raising them is proof enough that she is nothing but a hypocrite. This is evident in her frequent involvement with states such as Turkey and Pakistan who have emerged as the new axis of Islam. Both states have a pathetic record of how they treat their minorities. In Pakistan, every single week, a Hindu minor girl is either raped or forcefully married and converted to Islam. For all these players, India is just a punching bag which they use to amass more credibility and material benefits from the Islamists.Since India is a rising power, it is bound to face more vicious attacks in the time to come. But the likes of Ilhan Omar must be exposed for what they really are — a racist bigot who panders to one of the most authoritarian states in the world.The author is a PhD in International Relations from the Department of International Relations, South Asian University.

"Despite the absence of star batter, Smriti Mandhana, India started their World Cup campaign with a stellar victory against arch-rivals Pakistan. Team India will now take on West Indies at the Newlands Cricket Ground on February 15 in their second group game. Jemimah Rodrigues shone with the bat scoring 53 runs from 38 balls.

Harmanpreet Kaur and Co will hope to continue their winning momentum when they take on the Windies at the Newlands Cricket Ground.In contrast, West Indies women began their campaign with a heavy seven-wicket loss at the hands of England. Nat Sciver-Brunt played a pivotal role for the English women with bat and ball, helping them overcome the West Indies side.

"We have to talk about the looks of the OnePlus Buds Pro. They look gorgeous. The chunky design, the matte finish on the black color option, the dual tone finish highlighting the touch sensitive areas on either stem, as well as the matching matte finish on the charging case, In fact, the case has a design that allows you place each bud in a lying down position, rather than dropping them in like you'd do on an Apple AirPods Pro. The stem has some visual heft but is significantly shorter than you'd expect. , OnePlus phones still get the convenience of the built-in fast pairing and deeper integration of functionality within the Bluetooth menu, other Android phone users and Apple iPhone users can download the Hey Melody app instead, The thing with this generation is that non-OnePlus phone users aren't exactly at the sort of disadvantage that first generation OnePlus Buds buyers were. Sure, OnePlus phones still get the convenience of the built-in fast pairing and deeper integration of functionality within the Bluetooth menu, In each ear are 11mm dynamic audio drivers. OnePlus has time and again insisted that these are tuned better for lower frequencies, and therefore more bass reproduction. In the out-of-the-box state of tune, there is definitely more bass to experience than a lot of other earbuds would be able to reproduce. Yet, it doesn't sound artificially boosted, Something truly unique to the OnePlus Buds Pro is the Zen Mode Air. You'll need to hold the stem on the OnePlus Buds Pro for three seconds to switch this on, and you can choose from a variety of nature and soothing sounds to play back. Might be very useful if you are really stressed, OnePlus says that the maximum noise cancellation is 40dB, and to be honest, you'd have to be in a really noisy environment for something louder to still filter through a bit, Charging up the OnePlus Buds Pro will not be a problem at all. This has the same USB-C charging interface as most newer generation Android phones. The case is wireless charging enabled too and shall work with any Qi enabled wireless charger","The OnePlus Buds Pro are priced at Rs 9,990 and are available in the black as well as white colour options. Our review is based on the black variant, with the matte finish.","The OnePlus Buds Pro has a design that allows you place each bud in a lying down position, rather than dropping them in like you'd do on an Apple AirPods Pro."
"Amazon is expanding its Prime Video userbase in India with its new Mobile edition yearly plan that costs Rs 599 for one year. The new plan is part of Amazon's Prime Video offering, separate from its regular Prime subscription plans that are available in the country. Amazon has seen the demand for mobile-based viewing among Indians with its special Mobile edition pack that was available through telcos in the country so far. And it clearly believes that a standalone pack in this direction will aid its growth in the number of users availing of its video streaming service. The Prime Video Mobile Edition offers Amazon's content in standard definition (SD) quality, and users can be on any mobile network to sign up for this plan. This plan only works on a phone, so you can only watch live matches, or Amazon's original content through the Android and iOS apps. Interestingly, Amazon is giving users the option to download content via this plan for offline viewing. It is possible that Amazon wants to appeal to the customers with the Prime Video Mobile edition, give them the chance to explore the catalogue, and once they feel convinced, switch to the higher-priced plans that let them watch shows on TV, and laptops up to 4K resolution. This is the first time since its introduction in the Indian market that Amazon sees Prime Video as a viable product that has caught the eyes of viewers in the country. The standalone plan is similar to the Netflix Mobile version, but at Rs 599 for 12 months, it is undoubtedly cheaper than what the rival video streaming platform has to offer in the country. The Prime Video Mobile Edition comes to Rs 50 for one month, while Netflix commands Rs 149 for its mobile-only plan, and Disney+ Hotstar has its mobile-centric service available for around Rs 41 per month.Read all the Latest Tech News here",Amazon offered its mobile-centric plan through select telecom operators in the country but now it is going to compete with Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar in this segment.,"The Prime Video Mobile Edition offers Amazon's content in standard definition (SD) quality, and users can be on any mobile network to sign up for this plan."
"BSP supremo Mayawati on Sunday lashed out at the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan, saying the minimum guaranteed income bill passed by it is aimed at serving its 'political interest' ahead of assembly polls.The Rajasthan Assembly on Friday passed a bill to provide minimum guaranteed income to all adult citizens as part of a welfare package for the state.'The Gehlot government kept sleeping like 'Kumbhakarna' throughout its tenure and remained embroiled in internal political upheavals, otherwise many works related to public welfare, poverty, unemployment, backwardness could have been started by the government much earlier in public interest,' she said.'The announcement of minimum guarantee income scheme by the Congress government in Rajasthan before the assembly elections is less of public interest and more of a decision stemming from political interest. Due to this, it is difficult for the poor people to get immediate relief.

"The Nagaland government Tuesday decided to extend its latest phase of unlocking till October 31 with more relaxations, officials said. The state government has been announcing the unlocking process in a phased manner since July 1 and the current Unlock phase six was to end on September 30. The decision was taken at a review meeting of the High Powered Committee (HPC) on Covid-19 helmed by Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, government spokesperson and minister Neiba Kronu said. The government decided to relax the night curfew timing by an hour and keep it in force from 10 pm to 4 am, he said.The HPC also permitted the functioning of all religious places including churches and places of worship with 100 per cent capacity. However, they have to strictly adhere to the laid down SOPs and also follow Covid appropriate behaviour (CAB) at all times, he said.Sports activities and other mass gatherings will also be permitted by strictly adhering to CAB, he said. The government spokesperson also informed that while the decision to open schools for the conduct of physical classes for classes 5 and above from October 1 still stands, the HPC has decided to open all categories of educational institutes, including pre-primary levels from November 1 if the situation continues to improve. He said that those fully vaccinated or who have taken one dose of vaccine at least 15 days before undertaking the journey would be allowed to travel to Nagaland.

"UPI transactions in India, which is the leading instrument for the consumer FinTech sector in the country, stands at a juncture to grow at 22 percent cumulative growth rate to hit total transaction volume of Rs 6.2 lakh crore (USD 84 billion) by 2025, said Rajesh Bansal, chief executive of the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub (RBIH). Speaking at a keynote session of the Global FinTech Festival that opened earlier today, Bansal underlined key areas of growth that the Indian digital payments and FinTech sector can cash in to grow in the immediate future, and committed to the RBIH's plans to be an enabler in this sector for nascent startups.Highlighting key data points in the UPI transactions scheme of things, Bansal stated how today, 81 percent, or four out of every five UPI transactions done today, are conducted as P2P transactions - or between two individuals. This, Bansal highlighted, leaves massive scope for the business end to adopt digital payments, thereby backing up his growth projection for the digital payments sector. Even among users, Bansal claimed as per RBIH data that only 43 percent of all urban and rural internet users are active on the internet, and only 46 percent of this subset of the Indian population are using digital payments actively.Bansal further stated that even with just about one fifth of the Indian population actively transacting digitally, the nation's total volume of UPI transactions today stand at Rs 2.29 lakh crore (USD 31 billion). Despite this, Bansal stated that India today lags behind most of the 37 other nations that are part of the global Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in the cash to GDP ratio. 'While most OECD nations have a cash to GDP ratio of less than 5 percent, the same ratio for India today stands at 14.1 percent. This is too high, but at the same, showcases the massive scope of growth that players in the FinTech space can cash in on, in the near future,' Bansal said.In conversation with Suniti Nanda, ex-FinTech Officer for the Government of Maharashtra, Bansal highlighted the need for instant credit among micro entrepreneurs and enterprises as a key area that FinTech players must focus on in terms of the growth scope. 'There are over 70 million (7 crore) dairy farmers in India, and over 80 million (8 crore) beneficiaries of government schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. Furthermore, only a mere 8 percent of all micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) today have instant credit access - which clearly highlights the massive scope of growth for companies in this segment,' Bansal added.Bansal further highlighted target consumers such as the over 11 crore individuals enrolled in the PM-Kisan scheme, and a startling highlight that claimed how over 50 percent of women in India only make limited use of their bank accounts, as key areas of growth for FinTech players in the country. To support these players, Bansal underlined the setting up of a main Bengaluru office and a secondary Mumbai office for the RBIH, and stated that the body will work as an enabler of processes and offer assistance to FinTech businesses in the near future.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.","Rajesh Bansal, chief executive of the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub, highlighted opportunities of growth for the FinTech sector in India, and underlined key areas that require innovation.",
"Make in India. Made in India. Atmanirbhar Bharat. Three phrases that have brought the attention, and perhaps rightly so, back on Indian brands too. That includes smartphones as well, of course, and Micromax's really strong reemergence is an extremely positive indicator for the Indian smartphone market. Particularly at and around the more affordable Android smartphone price points, which are incredibly popular with the masses. More options for us. More choice. More competition. In the end, better products for us to buy. Speaking of better products leads me neatly to the Micromax IN 1, the newest smartphone that is also dubbed 'India Ka Naya Blockbuster'. The thing is, competition is even tougher now, just a handful of months after its siblings, the IN 1b and the IN Note 1, arrived on the scene. The work is clearly cut out for the Micromax IN 1. It is one of those finer things that you may not notice but if you do, it is easy to appreciate. The Micromax IN 1, in terms of the price, slots in between the IN 1b and the IN Note 1. That means, the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage option costs Rs 10,499 and the promised 6GB + 128GB variant will carry a sticker price of Rs 11,999. To illustrate what I just pointed out, the Micromax IN 1b is priced at Rs 6,999 (2GB + 32GB) and Rs 7,999 (4GB + 64GB+) while the IN Note 1 costs Rs 10,999 (4GB + 64GB) and Rs 12,499 (4GB + 128GB). Competition is incredibly tough, make no mistake about that. The pricing pegs it in competition, depending on specs and variants, of the Xiaomi Redmi 9 Prime and indeed the Xiaomi Redmi 9. Then there's the Realme C12 and the Realme C15. As an Android phone user, there are plenty of choices for you to take your pick from. That is perhaps also why Micromax has a special pricing of the IN 1 for those who buy the phone in the very first sale. The special pricing is Rs 9,999 (4GB + 64GB) and Rs 11,499 (6GB + 128GB).There's that old world charm to the Micromax IN 1's overall design. I've looked long and hard, but not been able to put my finger on exactly what it is. But you may agree with me that this has some elements of the previous generation of affordable Android phones, particularly with the gradient-esque finish on the back. It is not the slimmest phone, measuring 8.99mm to be specific, but hold it up, and it feels much slimmer than that. Whatever design trickery there is, it has clearly worked. There's the 3.5mm headphone jack too—which is great, and particularly for Android phones that don't cost a lot of money. There's the somewhat shimmering X pattern on the back, and the plastic feels good quality. At times, it feels a tad thinner than what you may have preferred, but there isn't any unnerving flex or any irritating rough edges with the build and design of the Micromax IN 1. Micromax promises that this back panel will not be a fingerprint magnet, and I'm happy to report back that it absolutely doesn't catch any fingerprints or smudges. Except the camera module, which is still a glossy black finish. But the entire back does show up dust quite effortless though.The fingerprint sensor sits on the back, but if I am completely honest, the same being integrated in the power key (albeit that would have required a completely different design) would have taken the experience a notch higher.The Micromax IN 1 runs the MediaTek Helio G80 chip, which for intents and purposes, will be very similar to the likes of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processor that powers a lot of the phones around the Rs 10,000 price point. There are two RAM configurations to choose from—4GB and for a bit more, 6GB. I'd honestly recommend paying that extra for the 6GB RAM variant, which also gets you 128GB storage instead of 64GB, for the additional performance headroom that comes with it. You may feel 4G is more than enough now, but with more apps you use, it may not be enough 12 months down the line. Get that extra buffer if you intend to hold on to the phone for a while. In terms of the pricing as well, the Micromax IN 1 sits just below the IN Note 1, which has the slightly more powerful MediaTek Helio G85 chip. Performance is exactly how I expected it to be—it delivers on exactly what an affordable Android phone should do, without really feeling the load. There isn't any hesitation as apps open or you switch between them. The processor, storage and RAM will eventually have a virtual ceiling after which you'll start to notice some stutters, but for most users, your apps will be able to stay well within that if you don't leave a multitasking clutter on your phone.What helps is the fact that system resources are free-er because there isn't any additional interface wrapped around Android. Nor are there tweaks that you may or may not want to the software, and perhaps the most important bit—there are absolutely no preloaded third-party apps on the phone. That makes the Micromax IN 1 one of the truly rare phones to offer a pristine clean Android experience, and also not have a single preloaded app. Nokia phones replicate this sort of seamless experience around the Rs 10,000 price point, but that's it. Most rivals give you Android that is heavily customized, have a plethora of third-party apps preloaded and waiting to give you a nasty surprise on your new phone and the performance eventually takes a hit at some point down the road. Do remember though, the Android 11 update is in the works and Micromax says the IN 1 should see the new update land sometime in May this year. That's the only work in progress, so to say.No need to go running to find the charger or a wall socket too. The big 5,000mAh battery returns good stamina levels as well. A freshly set up phone, with a million things being synced in the background and used for extensive screen use (YouTube and web browsing), social media apps to waste a lot of time (the clock ticks and you don't realize how much time is wasted) as well as the camera, lasted a day and a half before it blinked and had to be charged again. It is safe to assume that your usage won't be this heavy every day, and that means the Micromax IN 1 won't give you any battery anxiety. The 18-watt fast charger is bundled with the phone, and it is these little things that really add value.This is a large phone, and it really doesn't try to hide its footprint. The 6.67-inch display, with the native 2400 x 1080 resolution, ticks off the brightness, visibility, crispness and colour points on the checklist. There is no 90Hz or 120Hz display refresh rate play here, and that isn't something you should be expecting from a sub-Rs 10,000 phone. You can set the display colours with three presets—Standard, Vivid and Cool as well as the Customize option for manually tweaking the overall look. The blacks aren't the deepest, which makes the Dark Mode a bit of a dark grey mode or something like that.The only non-Google app on the Micromax IN 1 is the camera app, which is Micromax's own solution since that has to drive a whole host of multi-camera photography modes, AI smarts and more. And speaking of the camera itself, the IN 1 gets a triple camera system at the back. It's a 48-megapixel wide camera + 2-megapixel macro camera + 2-megapixel depth sensor combination, but what is missing is an ultrawide camera. That being said, it may not necessarily be a limitation for most users. It doesn't take long to realize that the Micromax IN 1's camera has the habit of brightening certain frames a bit more than it is strictly necessary. That means for certain daytime and good light shots, you need to frame it in a way that a light source from a side doesn't end up looking overexposed. It is a bit unexpected but having to wring photos out from a modern-day smartphone camera, particularly with the megapixel count ticked off, just feels off. Mind you, this isn't the first time a phone's camera has overexposed light sources and it is something that can be fixed with a firmware update.For the frames that don't require so much effort, you will see a pleasant return of good colours, adequate crispness and a general sense of vibrancy that doesn't overplay its role. A lot of phones have AI modes that really dial up the colour saturation and contrast, but Micromax's implementation of this AI does things in an appreciably understated way and doesn't add any unnatural elements to the framing. Most photos look well balanced, and I really like the handling of different colours. Yet, I do come away with the feeling that this isn't a camera which you can hurry up with—not something you can take out of the pocket, open the camera app and quickly take a photo without having to bother about anything. There are times when manual focus becomes important, and I did notice a few times that moving the camera away too soon after tapping the shutter button returns a blurry image. Take your time with the Micromax IN 1's camera, is the takeaway, and you'll get a nice return of daytime photos.Low light photos are where the additional exposure tendency plays a positive part, at most times. There's more illumination for darkened areas of the frame, which means you see more details. That being said, you cannot zoom in much on these photos without some noise making its presence felt. But these will work, for most social media posts. Colours are a bit on the cooler side from time to time, but that would be my preference over a lot of smartphone cameras that either lean towards too much warmth or oversaturation due to boosting.The Last Word: As Effortless As An Affordable Android Phone Can BeThe Micromax IN 1 just adds credence to my belief that the Indian smartphone market really needs a strong showing by Indian brands such as Micromax. That's even more true in the affordable Android smartphone space. The Micromax IN 1, which joins the IN 1b and the IN Note 1 as the third phone in the line-up, is delivering on what one would expect from an affordable Android smartphone that sits well inside the Rs 10,000 price point. Its built well, looks good with no real rough edges so to speak of, retains the 3.5mm headphone jack, delivers on consistent performance with solid battery life, a display that just works without a million features and options to complicate things and a camera that needs some effort but eventually delivers good photos. This isn't a 5G phone, and to be fair, you don't need to worry about that at this point of time. And the latest Android update is in the works, which is something that will add even more value to a very good phone.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here","For the Micromax IN 1, competition is tougher now, than what the IN 1b and IN Note 1 faced.

"What do Jatavs as a socio-political community represent in UP politics? Jatavs are a numerically strong Dalit community in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh and constitute around 10-12 per cent of state's population. Dalits, together, constitute an estimated 21.6 per cent of the state population. In other words, Jatavs are everywhere in UP, in almost every district and every constituency.Before 1990, Jatavs were known to form the base vote of the Congress party. However, around early 1990s, they started shifting towards the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) led by Kanshiram and Mayawati. Now, over the years, they are known as the core vote or base vote of the BSP in Uttar Pradesh.To get a sense of the sentiment on the ground, I travelled to Dalit patti (colony) in Mungari village in Allahabad district. 'We are known as BSP supporters, hathi wale. Even when we say that we may vote for some other party, no one believes us,' a few old women in the colony told me.At a Dalit basti near Mohanlalganj, Lucknow, locals told me they were known as BSP supporters. At another Dalit colony near Chitrakoot in Bundelkhand, a Jatav youth told me, 'Everyone is supporting candidate(s) of their own jati-biradari (caste), why should we not?' BSP's strength lie in its base vote (Jatavs) and its political commitment to this core support group. And, this core vote base of the BSP is intact. This is despite no big rallies by Mayawati or a grand party campaign this election season, so far. Such rallies or campaigns do not affect political mobilisation of Jatavs; they may, to some extent, affect other Dalit castes like Pasis, Dhobis, Koris etc. The votes of these castes may get divided. Similarly, big rallies and aggressive campaign by Mayawati usually helps the BSP attract other non-Dalit castes and communities.The BSP is locked in triangular contests in many regions and in several seats of Uttar Pradesh, something that has remained under-reported.If one sees the caste profile of Dalit communities in Uttar Pradesh, Jatavs constitute nearly two-thirds of Dalit population in most districts, be it western UP, eastern UP or Bundelkhand. In many districts of Uttar Pradesh, Dalits comprise more than 30 per cent of total population. They have also emerged as an educated community, and one can easily observe the growing aspirations for socio-political and economic mobility among them. A salaried class is emerging within this community, and they have evolved capacity to demand representation in politics. And political parties like the Congress, the Republican Party of India and the BSP have tried to respond to these aspirations. The Bahujan movement in the 1980s and 1990s produced several leaders from this community who continue to remain active in politics and among various political forums across levels. The BSP is known as a factory that produces young Dalit leaders. Many young leaders from the Jatav caste are quite active in BSP politics. In fact, the BSP as a political organisation is driven largely by a cadre who have emerged from the Jatav caste. Many among them occupy various offices in local BSP units.The BSP strategy is to attract various non Jatav, non-Dalit castes that along with the Jatavs can raise the chances of winnability. In the BSP rainbow social alliance, Jatavs are at the centre, creating electoral bhaichara with various non-Dalit castes of 'Sarvjan' community. While Jatavs may appear as a homogeneous vote-bank for the BSP, growing political aspirations among its young members can also make them gravitate towards the BJP, the Congress and the Samajwadi Party. Both the BJP and the Congress have given them space in their party organisation and ticket distribution for various elections.Power is the master key for opening the doors of emancipation was a slogan given by Babasaheb Ambedkar and reinvented by Kanshiram. This slogan, in particular, has inspired Dalit youth, and the educated and socially and economically mobile Jatav community to demand their share in political power. Come March 10 and we will see how their vote will reshape politics of democracy in Uttar Pradesh.Badri Narayan is Professor and Director at GB Pant Social Science Institute, Prayagraj, and author of 'Republic of Hindutva'.

"Several Kashmiri Pandits took part in the Shobha Yatra on Ram Navami, which passed through the old city of Srinagar, amid tight security. Though the number of Kashmiri Pandits this year was fewer due to the fear of targeted killings, those who took part said they were not afraid and were taking this as an opportunity to send out a message of peace and harmony. The Shobha Yatra started from Zaindar Mohalla in the old city and culminated at Tankipora after passing through Habbakadal, Barbarshah, Lal Chowk, Hari Singh High Street and Jehangir Chowk.Every year, Kashmiri Pandits gather at Kathleshwar temple in Tankipora area of the old city and take out this procession, which goes through the old city and then enters the heart of Srinagar at Lal Chowk.

"Belfast: British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday was set to call on the European Union to strike a new deal to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland and demand Brussels quickly respond to her 'white paper' plan to avoid a damaging no-deal Brexit. In a speech due to be delivered in Belfast on Friday morning, May will accept the need to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic once Britain leaves the bloc, but will dismiss the EU's current plan as ""unworkable,"" according to extracts released by her office. Instead, May said the EU must engage with her Brexit 'white paper' policy document released earlier this month, which proposes negotiating the closest possible commercial links for goods trade to protect businesses and to fulfil a commitment to avoid having infrastructure on the border. It is ""now for the EU to respond. Not simply to fall back onto previous positions which have already been proven unworkable. But to evolve their position in kind,"" May is to tell a crowd at Belfast's Waterfront Hall, according to the text. Still reeling after her Brexit plan triggered the resignation of senior members of her cabinet, May flew to Northern Ireland on Thursday for a two-day visit to see up close the troubled British region's frontier with EU-member Ireland. The border has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the negotiations. The 500-kilometre (300 mile) border has been largely invisible since army checkpoints were taken down after a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of violence between the region's pro-British majority and an Irish nationalist minority. Over 3,600 died. May has refused to accept a ""backstop"" solution proposed by the European Union in which Northern Ireland would remain closely aligned with the European Union's single market and customs union on the grounds that it would create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. ""The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal 'third country' customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British Prime Minister could ever accept,"" May is to tell a crowd at Belfast's Waterfront Hall, according to the text. The Irish government, which has said it has concerns about May's white paper, on Friday said a backstop was essential, but could be renegotiated. ""The only thing that could replace this current form of a backstop is, No. 1 something which is better; No. 2 something which is agreed and No. 3 something that would be legally operable,"" Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told RTE radio. The EU has warned business to get ready for Britain crashing out of the bloc without agreed terms, although officials and diplomats still think some kind of deal is more likely than not, if only because the cost for both sides would be so high. While May is trying to convince Brussels to make concessions on Northern Ireland, she is also trying to shore up support in her Conservative Party after her white paper proposals sparked cabinet level resignations last week. After quitting, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson singled out her treatment of the border as the biggest mistake of her negotiations with the EU for a smooth exit from the bloc next year. Johnson on Wednesday told parliament that May had unnecessarily let the ""readily soluble"" border issue ""become so politically charged as to dominate the debate"" pushing May towards a close alignment with the EU he described as a ""miserable, permanent limbo"".","In a speech due to be delivered in Belfast on Friday morning, May will accept the need to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic once Britain leaves the bloc, but will dismiss the EU's current plan as ""unworkable,"" according to extracts released by her office.",
"Every time someone in India (politician, media anchor or scientist) declares emphatically that we have attained herd immunity and no longer need to fear the virus, SARS-CoV-2 serves a reminder that it has new tricks to reveal. It happened before Alpha seared us and then again before Delta scorched us. Arrival of the Omicron variant follows fresh claims of herd immunity, which led to abandonment of COVID-appropriate behaviour in many parts of India during the festive season of October-November 2021. It is ironic that those who claimed a cast iron protection for the people of Delhi, with 97 per cent antibody test positivity in the sixth serological survey in October 2021, are among the first to demand a ban on flights from any country reporting the new variant. What a confession of vulnerability, despite the bravado! A misplaced belief that India had seen the end of COVID was based on the assumption that most Indians have acquired immunity against the Delta variant during the devastating second wave, with the faster pace of vaccination thereafter providing additional protection. This optimistic view did not factor in possible emergence of new variants from unvaccinated persons in India or their entry from other countries. Hence the consternation, bordering on panic, that has been on display when Omicron emerged most unexpectedly. There has been much speculation about the infectivity, virulence and immune evasion capacity of Omicron, even as data are scant at present and studies have just begun. This is reminiscent of Mark Twain's wry remark 'there is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.' While virus variants are no trifling matter, conjectures are running far ahead of available evidence. While public health prudence and political sagacity demand that we take protective action even on the basis of incomplete information, we should not rush to rash conclusions about how dangerous the new variant would be to infected individuals, populations at risk within countries and the interconnected global community. Scientific information and analyses are still emerging.Understanding OmicronIt is likely that Omicron is highly transmissible from person to person. This is based on the mutations which it shares with Delta and several added new features. These give it higher replication rates in the upper respiratory tract, especially the throat. It has a greater ability to grip and attach itself to human cells using many of its 32 spike protein mutations to cling to the ACE2 receptors on cell surface. The speed with which it appears to have spread among people in the Gauteng province of South Africa and the detection of copious viral presence in the sewage water of Pretoria indicate that the virus spreads fast within a country. As the UK and Europe are adding to the daily list of new locations where cases are emerging (Portugal and Scotland being among the recent ones), global spread is attesting to high early transmissibility. It is unclear, however, whether it will displace the dominant delta from many parts of the world. The Formula One race for the variants is now on! In contrast, more mutations do not by themselves indicate increased virulence. The principal objectives of mutations, as the virus tries to retain its presence in a world that is combating it, are to become more infectious and better at evading the immunity that has been conferred by vaccines or previous infection. It has no survival advantage in killing most of the humans it infects, if the supply of unprotected people is dwindling. Indeed, early reports from South Africa report no deaths so far and only mild symptoms not requiring hospitalisation. We need more information, from larger case series around the world, but early indications are of lower virulence as a trade-off for increased infectivity. That is consistent with the evolutionary biology of respiratory viruses. Immune evasion or escape is of great concern, as it might lead to more 'breakthrough' infections in the fully vaccinated and 're-infections' in those who had recovered from illness caused by earlier versions of the virus. As we know by now, currently available COVID vaccines do not prevent infections by the virus. They prevent the infections from leading to severe illness resulting in hospitalisation or death. As transmission rates increase in community settings, reinfections and breakthrough infections too will rise but will mostly result in mild illness.Most of the vaccines used around the world are 'spike protein' specific. The mRNA and virus-vector vaccines have been designed to produce the spike protein in our bodies, so that a strong immune response can be generated against it. Since it is this protein which is used by the virus to enter our cells, antibodies generated against it can immobilise the virus in the blood stream, before it can enter the cells. Omicron's shape-changing spike protein mutations may make it unrecognisable to the spike-specific antibodies. While there is a scientific basis for this concern, previous variants like Delta showed a diminished but still effective response to the current vaccines. Vaccine manufacturers are now preparing to tweak their vaccines against Omicron's spike protein configuration. An inactivated virus vaccine, like Covaxin, presents a larger array of viral antigens to the human immune system. The broadband immunity it evokes is not spike protein specific and, therefore, may be better able to counter the variant. This still needs to be confirmed in laboratory neutralisation studies. The situation may be similar for persons who were infected with earlier versions of the virus. They too would have immunity not only against the surface spike protein but also against other antigens that lie deeper in the virus. So, Omicron may be able to evade the anti-spike antibodies but will still yield to the antibodies against the other antigens as well as the cell-mediated component of the immune response. Fight the Virus as Team WorldTo prevent infections in the first place, we need to both boost our natural immunity and adopt COVID-appropriate behaviours. This is an old refrain but needs to be repeated as people revert to unsafe behaviours when they feel that the danger is absent or minimal. Nutritious diets (rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts and protein), moderate physical activity, adequate sleep and breathing exercises can bolster innate immunity. Masks have to be worn outdoor and in crowded indoor locations. Homes, offices, shops and transport should be as well-ventilated as possible. Hand hygiene must be practised.Travel bans may temporarily slow down but not prevent spread of the virus globally. They are counter-productive in many ways. We need to have strong entry point surveillance, effective identification of cases and contacts through appropriate testing accompanied by higher levels of genomic analyses of positive samples and gearing up of our health system for a more intense level of pandemic response. Vaccination coverage too must increase, to complete two-dose universal adult vaccination, followed by boosters for vulnerable adults and initiation of child vaccination for vulnerable children.COVID does not let you forget that health is central to our development agenda. It has just sent another teacher to give us fresh lessons and also to test our retention of previous learning. It is up to us to prove that we are good pupils who can apply past knowledge and quickly adapt to new instructional methods. Do not play hooky in crowded streets, screaming from unmasked faces that the virus has been driven away. We can and must pass this test, not just as Team India but as Team World. Professor K.

"Two contrasting events were witnessed from a political spectrum. One was the victory rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the party's spectacular victory in Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya, and the second was Congress leader Raul Gandhi's criticism of the Indian government at Cambridge University.Rahul Gandhi's address at Cambridge University reflected his desperation and frustrations at not being able to do much to oust the Modi government. The bad news of a washout in the three states of Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland was projected in the Exit Polls. The results that came later vindicated the Congress' worst fear of a complete washout in states where it expected to perform better.Rahul Gandhi's baseless charges of being spied on by using Pegasus would invite questions as to why he did not get his mobile phone checked if he was so sure. Also, the Supreme Court-appointed committee that looked into the issue could not find anything to substantiate that Pegasus was used. Of the 29 phones that were investigated 'malware or poor cyber hygiene' were found in five, but it could not be established if these were Pegasus.The committee said that the government did not cooperate, but the government had maintained that there was no unauthorised snooping on anyone. It was the job of the committee of experts to probe any wrongdoings and not the government since the charges were against the latter. Rahul's utterances showed that he would believe rumours and not facts.Similarly, when the world is appreciating India's vibrant democracy, a leader of the Opposition is saying that democracy is in danger. What has prevented Rahul Gandhi from going to the people and garnering support? No one stopped his Bharat Jodo Yatra from taking place. The very fact that he was frolicking in the snow in Kashmir with his sister testify that the situation in the Valley had become much better, reflecting a triumph of democracy.He spoke about minorities being unsafe in India. This is contrary to facts. The record shows that minorities have benefited more from government schemes. The Minorities Affairs Ministry has asserted that of the 2.31 crore houses built under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana: '31 percent were allocated in 25 minority-dominated areas, 33 percent beneficiary of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi were minorities, and out of the nine crore beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, 37 percent were from the minority communities.' This is not discrimination but more care for minorities without adopting the policy of appeasement.All charges of Rahul Gandhi would prove to be politically motivated and mischievous and based on lies and misconceptions. It is more dangerous when such leaders try to sully the image of the Modi government through such irresponsible utterances. They forget that the Modi government represents the India of today. When the whole world is looking at India as an island of hope in terms of economic recovery and implementation of good governance practices, such statements merely end up helping anti-India forces.While Rahul was projecting himself as a loser by attacking the Modi government in a foreign land, the Prime Minister was full of positivity about the party, the country and people in general. The BJP's victory in the three states proves something which Modi's detractors would not concede.Describing the vote as one for progress and stability, Modi said that the secret to the BJP's success lay in the new formula enshrined in the concept of Triveni (Amalgamation of Three streams). These were: (1) Work done by the BJP governments; (2) Ethics of the BJP governments; and (3) Helping nature of the BJP workers. This Triveni enhances the power of BJP by 1+1+1 which equals 111 times, he said.Rahul should ask himself how many times he or anyone from the Gandhi family visited the Northeast to link with people even during the campaign. If he wishes to understand the Prime Minister, he should merely try to figure how many times he visited or addressed the people of Northeast. Between 2017 and 2022, Modi visited the Northeast 44 times. The landscape of the Northeast is changing with development indicators.The victory is a vindication that if one works hard to provide solutions, people develop a stake in continuation of the government which is often termed pro-incumbency. Indian politics is becoming mature and only those who would work tirelessly to meet aspirations of people would survive. Political rhetoric or unnecessary criticisms or poison-laced abuses full of hatred would not give political dividends.The writer is the convener of the media relations department of the BJP and represents the party as a spokesperson on TV debates.

"The so-far completely autonomous IIMs are likely to have their autonomy diluted as the President is set to be the 'visitor' to all the institutes with powers to conduct an audit of their functioning, order inquiries as well as appoint or remove its directors, as per a bill to amend the Indian Institutes of Management Act, 2017, introduced in Lok Sabha on Friday.The bill being introduced in parliament met with disruptions made by the opposition over the Manipur situation. According to the new bill, the President of India shall be the Visitor of every IIM.'The Visitor may appoint one or more persons to review the work and progress of any institute and to hold inquiries into the affairs thereof and to report thereon in such manner as the Visitor may direct,' the draft bill stated.So far, the premier IIMs under the existing Act allowed these business schools greater autonomy to be run by its board of governors, with each institute having 19 members including only one representative each from central and state governments.The board had the power to make decisions on policy questions related to administration and working of the institutes. Here are some of the powers held by the board of governors of the IIMs:Examining and approval of annual budget estimates; establishing departments, faculties or school of studiesSetting up centres of management studies and allied areas within the country under intimation to the central governmentGranting degrees, diplomas and other academic distinctions or titlesCreating academic, administrative, technical and other postsMaking appointments provided that the cadre, pay scales, allowances and terms of employment shall be as per rules laid down by the CentreNominating its remaining members from among eminent personalities, faculty and alumniForming panels for the appointment of new directors and chairpersons, and finalising those appointments.The draft amendment bill, however, proposes that the search-cum-selection panel for the director's appointment will have a Visitor's nominee. '…the services of the director may be terminated by the Visitor, in such a manner as may be prescribed…' the draft stated.Last year, the ministry of education (MoE) had informed the institutes about a new procedure being worked out to form search-cum-selection committees for the appointment of chairpersons. The board of governors of the institutes were asked to extend the tenure of the existing chairpersons till the new procedure comes into place.This, however, did not go down well with the administration of the institutes with several board members describing it as 'interference in their matters'. Concerns were raised on the possible dilution of the autonomy of the IIMs.Amid disruptions in the House, the bill will now come up for consideration and passage next week, said minister of state for parliamentary affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal while listing out government business for next week.","The Visitor to all the IIMs will have powers to conduct audit of their functioning, order inquiries as well as appoint or remove its directors",

"Area 51 has got nothing on the Zone of Death. This 50-square-mile area in Yellowstone National Park, United States is a place that has plenty to offer. This includes the theoretical idea that it will be hard to prosecute someone if they committed a crime here. So, in theory, this is the area you could murder someone and the court might let you walk away free. Unilad explained that it is all because of a legal loophole all thanks to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This was founded in 2005 by Brian C Kalt, a law professor. To break it down simply, the Sixth Amendment declares that a person who is on trial must face a jury from the state and district where they committed the crime.The Zone of Death is special. Yellowstone falls under the jurisdiction of the state of Wyoming. This is because the vast majority of the area of the national park is there. But it is also in the surrounding states of Montana and Idaho. Now, if the crime was committed in Idaho, according to the Six Amendment the jury will have to be from there. But under the judicial district of Wyoming.The only place that fulfils these criteria is that 50-mile area. Sounds easy enough? The problem is no one lives there. Since no one lives there, the place has no person to pick the jury from. In the United States, a jury is needed to put a person on trial. With no one on the jury, in theory, you can walk away even after committing the most heinous crimes in the area.It sounds all fun and games until being proved wrong. The Atlantic in The Experiment podcast covered a case that happened in the Zone of Death. In December 2005, Mike Belderrain committed the crime of illegally shooting an elk. This act was committed in the area of Yellowstone that is in Montana. Using Kalt's theory he argued that he could not be tried unless a jury is selected from the Montana residents of the park. While it was technically possible, it was a difficult case.The judge presiding the case was having none of it. It was declared that any crime committed in Yellowstone will be tried in Wyoming. Naturally, the jury would be selected from there too. Mike Belderrain took a plea deal and was sentenced to four years in prison.","Theoretically, since no residents live in this area, no jury can be made for a trial. Hence, the convict gets to walk away free. But the reality is different.","To break it down simply, the Sixth Amendment declares that a person who is on trial must face a jury from the state and district where they committed the crime."
"Will the movie Razakar - The Silent Genocide of Hyderabad stir up emotions like The Kashmir Files did? The poster of the movie was recently released in the presence of BJP leaders in Hyderabad. The graphic poster of the film shows a Brahmin impaled on a bayonet and surrounded by bodies. Director Yata Satyanarayana, however, said at the launch that the movie had not been made to sow seeds of discontent among people. The Razakars are an emotive chapter in the history of Hyderabad; they were a paramilitary force of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM), who primarily committed atrocities against Hindus. The outfit became extremist under the leadership of Qasim Razvi, a lawyer from Maharashtra's Latur. He became close to the Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, and dreamt of establishing a Muslim theocracy. He coined the slogan 'Anal Malik', which means every Muslim in the state is a ruler.But it has to be noted that the Razakars were also used by Hindu landlords to quell armed rebellion by communists. A few well-known Muslim activists, too, were killed by the Razakars.Brutal rape captured in folklore'The Razakars plundered Hindu villages and raped many women. It is difficult to estimate the number because no formal reports were released about the atrocities,' said RSS ideologue and senior journalist Raka Sudhakar Rao, who narrated the story of Nakka Andalamma. She was disrobed, raped and then made to perform Bathukamma rituals and later killed herself by jumping into a well.Her story was narrated by folk singers and other groups till the late 1980s. 'There are many stories about men being made to stand in a line and being shot. In Maharashtra alone, they razed 400 Hindu villages, while 300 houses were burnt in a village in Karnataka. The Nizam government provided them all kinds of support,' Rao said.'In the initial stages, the Razakars were involved in conversion activities only. They were not armed. After Razvi became the chief of the MIM, they were armed and started targeting Hindus. They were also employed by Hindu landlords to fight communists,' he added.Razakars came amid deep communal divide'Islamic communalism started in Hyderabad in the mid 1930s,' said N Venugopal, editor of 'Veekshanam' magazine. Tablighis would go from village to village to persuade people to embrace Islam. 'Some of the early converts were Dalits from the Madiga community. Almost simultaneously, members of the Arya Samaj launched 'shuddhikaran' ceremonies to reconvert them. After 1937, there was a deep communal divide in the Hyderabad state due to these activities - something that had not been witnessed before despite Hyderabad being ruled by Muslim rulers for 400 years. Till then, all riots had been between Sunnis and Shias. Hyderabad witnessed its first communal riot in 1938. It was against this background that Razvi rose to power,' said the editor.Razvi wanted theocracy'The Nizam never considered Hyderabad to be a Muslim state as 80 percent of the population were Hindus. However, Razvi wanted it to be a theocracy. He coined the slogan 'Anal Malik',' Venugopal said.Razakars were supposed to empower Muslims, but their foot soldiers were Dalits and Dalit converts. In 1944, the Telangana armed struggle began and the feudal landlords used them as a vigilante force against communists.With such a chequered history, it remains to be seen how the movie portrays Razakars, who were disbanded after Hyderabad was merged with India in 1948. With the assembly elections a few months away, the movie, which is being produced by a BJP leader, might be used to influence voters.","A poster of the movie, 'Razakar - The Silent Genocide of Hyderabad', was recently released in presence of BJP leaders.

"The Uniform Civil Code (UCC) is an embodiment of Article 44 of the Indian Constitution which seeks the implementation of a uniform set of laws, governing the personal affairs of citizens, pertaining to the institution of marriage and the ancillary rights arising out of the same such as inheritance, alimony, guardianship and adoption, amongst others with the sole object of national consolidation. This is based on the assumption that there is no intimate link between personal laws and religious affairs in a civilised society. The idea of a UCC ignited a spark in 1947 when most Indians were unaffected by the secular civil and criminal laws which were implemented by the British since it struck the very essence of the orthodoxy that all of our religious communities possessed.While the UCC was proposed in the Constituent Assembly to reform the orthodoxy of India's religious communities in a bid to protect the rights of the citizens, especially women who were largely affected by our country's personal laws, all of which were regressive to an extent, the partition had invoked a fear within the Muslim community that they would be imposed upon by the Hindu majority. The Minorities Sub-Committee sought for the UCC to be amended such that its implementation would be voluntary. However, this was very beautifully countered by Dr BR Ambedkar, KM Munshi and Sir Alladi who highlighted the reforms in Muslim personal laws in countries such as Egypt and Turkey which led to the aforementioned amendment being rejected.As far as Muslim countries are concerned, polygamy is totally prohibited in Tunisia and Turkey. However, even in the case of countries such as Indonesia, Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Syria, Pakistan and Bangladesh, it is permissible only if it is authorised by the State or some other prescribed authority. Furthermore, Talaq-ul-Biddat has been legislatively abolished in Egypt, Jordan, Sudan and even Syria. Countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh have a bar on extra-judicial talaq being invalid unless received assent from an Arbitration Council. All of these are Islamic Republics, so there is no question of a Hindu imposition with regard to amending their personal laws and it highlights that Islamic Personal Law is not immutable. It is pertinent to note that these changes transpired in their personal laws decades ago.Contrary to the belief that bringing a UCC would splinter the secular fabric of the country, its very objective is to integrate the country by bringing all the communities under a common umbrella on matters which are currently governed by a diverse set of personal laws, which do not form the essence of any religion such as guardianship, alimony and maintenance, etc.The implementation of a Uniform Civil Code in India would bring several benefits, not only for Muslims but for the country as a whole. While it is essential to acknowledge and respect the diversity of religious practices and customs, it is equally important to ensure that fundamental rights, equality, and justice are upheld for all citizens, including Muslim women. The UCC seeks to extend the notion of equality and protection of individual liberty to all the citizens, who are discriminated against and aggrieved by the various personal laws, by not only applying a uniform set of laws but also affording uniform protection and benefits through them.Since the enactment of the Constitution, the Muslim personal laws of our country have been plagued by various patriarchal practices such as polygamy, nikah halala or not providing sufficient alimony and maintenance to wives after divorce, which has continued to emancipate women who, yet, have not fully gained independence in its truest sense. These patriarchal practices go against the very spirit and essence of the 'fundamental right to live with dignity' under Article 21 of the Constitution. Furthermore, Muslim Personal Law also does not allow for the legal adoption of children and it has proved to be significantly detrimental to their upbringing and their fundamental right to life and dignity. These merely highlight some of the issues that the UCC aims to tackle by providing equal protection under the law and ridding religious communities of their patriarchal practices.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and Asaduddin Owaisi have strongly opposed the implementation of the UCC, calling it neither necessary nor desirable, since it allegedly infringes upon their fundamental right to religion. The argument put forth by them is that Indian Muslim Law is immutable since it is directly derived from the Quran and cannot be amended. However, I strongly object to that since the Muslim Personal law in India is in fact Anglo-Muslim law. Prior to the enactment of the Shariat Act by the British, various Muslim communities such as those from UP and the Central provinces were governed by Hindu law in various aspects of personal law and in fact, the Khojas and the Cutchi Muslims who were not only followers of Hindu customs, were also one of the strongest objectors to the Shariat Act being made applicable to them.I am of the opinion that while the right to follow one's religion is fundamental, however, it is not an absolute right and is subject to principles such as public order and morality. A person's religious rights cannot be subservient to the fundamental right to equality and the right to live.The recurrent argument that the UCC is contrary to the Shariat needs to be understood in light of the fact that the UCC is a part of the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) under Article 44 of the Constitution and the only way to change the Constitution is by availing the special procedure prescribed for its amendment under Article 368(2), which requires a special majority in the parliament. If the AIMPLB and the supporters of their idealogue can convince the Parliament and get the support of the special majority, only then can the idea of putting the UCC at rest be fulfilled. This cannot be done either by sheer force or by seeking support from forces outside the country which belong to pan-Islamic organisations.I cannot think of a more appropriate quote than that of Chief Justice MC Chagla (Retd) who was not only a proud Muslim but a proud Indian. 'Article 44 is a mandatory provision binding the Government, and it is incumbent upon it to give effect to this provision. The Constitution was enacted for the whole country, it is binding for the whole country, and every section and community must accept its provisions and its directives.'Owaisi's statements primarily pertain to preserving one's religious identity and the same being protected under Article 29 of the Constitution, this is an argument that has been propounded since the inception of the idea of a UCC and has been reiterated multiple times by various leaders of the Muslim community. The great constitutional jurist, DD Basu, was of the opinion that the plea for a Muslim identity is merely a relic of the 'Two Nation Theory' which was propounded by the political leaders from the Muslim community who sought the partition of the country on communal lines, while the nationalistic Indian leaders were always of the strong belief that there is only one nation. There should not be any fears or apprehensions of losing religious identity for Muslims when the very Constitution which sought the implementation of the UCC also guarantees them the right to maintain institutions which are of the utmost importance for their religion, language and culture through the fundamental rights that have been bestowed upon them.In this pursuit of a progressive and harmonious society, it is crucial for all individuals, communities, and political leaders to come together and support the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code. Only through collective efforts and a shared vision can we truly uphold the principles of justice, equality, and unity that India stands for and what the makers of our Constitution had envisioned. As a Muslim woman myself, advocating for the UCC, I encourage my fellow citizens, regardless of their religious background, to embrace this transformative change.In this backdrop, it's heartening to know the findings of the News18 UCC survey which shows that a considerable majority of Muslim women support the introduction of common laws pertaining to marriage, divorce, adoption, and inheritance.Let us reaffirm our commitment to a pluralistic India, where the rights and well-being of every individual are safeguarded, and where the principles of equality and justice prevail.Zeba Zoriah writes on politics, policies, culture and women's rights.

"Apple launched its first in-house silicon chip M1-powered MacBook Air in November 2020. Now, it is being reported that the Cupertino-based giant is working on a thinner and lighter version of its entry-level laptop, a report citing people with knowledge of the matter said. According to the report, the next MacBook Air is scheduled to be released in the second half of this year at the earliest or in 2022. The Bloomberg report also said that the next MacBook Air will include Apple?s MagSafe charging technology, in line with a recent report that cited Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo as saying that Apple will bring back the magnetic charging port on its future MacBook laptops. The next MacBook Air is also said to be powered by a next-generation version of Apple?s in-house silicon chips. Apple has also discussed making the laptop smaller by shrinking the bezels around the screen, which will remain the same size at 13-inches, the report further said. The Bloomberg report also talks about Apple considering building a larger version of the MacBook Air with a 15-inch screen, but Apple isn?t moving forward with this for the next generation, the people close to the matter told Bloomberg. The Apple MagSafe charger (magnetic charging port) was removed from the MacBook Air in 2018 when the company brought a redesigned version of the laptop. The report also said that the new model will have a pair of USB 4 ports for connecting external devices. The new laptop is reported to be a higher-end version of the current MacBook Air, which is expected to remain as the company?s entry-level offering.

"Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar on Thursday called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a 'harbinger of change' and praised BJP for its pro-Muslim and pro-backward class approach for their welfare. In an interview to News18, perhaps the first one after he announced his return to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Rajbhar discussed his priorities at length, hinted his induction into Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's cabinet, but remained silent over the portfolio allocation. 'He just wants to serve the masses,' Rajbhar said about Modi. Over the distribution of tickets, allocation of portfolio and other crucial issues regarding the next year's Lok Sabha elections, Rajbhar said the final say would be of PM Modi, who will shortly hold a meeting with all 39 parties to decide over the same.Edited interviewQ: With your return to the NDA fold ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the speculations are that the Yogi Adityanath Cabinet in Uttar Pradesh will be reshuffled to accommodate you and Dara Singh Chauhan after he quit the Samajwadi Party (SP). How far is this correct?A: I am a servant and I believe in serving people, which I have been doing all these years. Hence, I want a department where I can serve humanity. However, the final decision over the distribution of tickets, the seat ratio will be finalised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the meeting, which is in the next couple of days.Q: OBC reservation, ban on liquor and other social issues have been raised by you and your party from time to time but the UP government is yet to give its say on them. So what is the reason behind the change in your stand?A: Our issues and agendas are still the same and we will continue to serve people with the same spirit and zeal. Recently, when I met PM Modi, I put across all our issues, long-pending demands before him. He appreciated our concern and assured us that it would all be resolved soon since, at present, the only target is 'Mission 2024' and to bring back Modi as the PM for the third time.Q: Since you have announced your return to the NDA, what will be the status of jailed gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari's son Abbas Ansari who contested from Mau seat on SBSP ticket and won by 38,116 votes, defeating Ashok Singh, a BJP candidate in the 2022 UP elections. Will he too be part of NDA?A: Abbas Ansari was an SP candidate. But since in the 2022 state assembly elections, SBSP was in alliance with SP, he was allowed to contest on SBSP ticket from Mau. Ansari had won the last assembly elections on our party's ticket, he will continue to be our party's MLA.Q: In one of your recent statements you have called the PM 'harbinger of change' and termed BJP the only party with pro-Muslim and pro-backwards approach that is working constantly for their welfare. How?A: Until 15 years ago, opening a bank account used to be a struggle for a common man. It was PM Narendra Modi ji who made it possible and now the benefits are being transferred to their bank accounts. It was he who made it all possible. He is a harbinger of change. In fact, BJP is among those political parties that has actually done something for the OBCs. Ayushman card, free ration, Jan Dhan Yojana are some of the schemes whose benefits have reached every individual.","In an interview with News18, SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has recently joined hands with NDA, said, at present, the only target is 'Mission 2024' and to bring back Modi as the Prime Minister for the third time",
"The World Press Freedom Day is celebrated every year on May 3 owing to a proclamation by UN General Assembly in December 1993 following a recommendation adopted at UNESCO's General Conference in 1991. According to the UN, the day is an opportunity to celebrate the fundamental principles of press freedom, assess the state of press freedom throughout the world, defend the media from attacks on their independence and pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the line of duty. Why May 3 is Celebrated As World Press Freedom Day A group of African journalists produced a Declaration at a UNESCO seminar, ""Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press,"" held in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia, from 29 April to 3 May 1991. The Windhoek Declaration for the Development of a Free, Independent and Pluralistic Press or Windhoek Declaration, as it would subsequently, be known as is considered to be a landmark document on media pluralism and independence. Windhoek Declaration led to developing countries drafting several similar documents: The Alma-Ata Declaration for central Asia, Sana'a Declaration for the Middle East, and the Santiago Declaration for Latin America and the Caribbean. The UNESCO seminar at Windhoek followed the East-West Roundtable set up by the global body's then Director-General, Federico Mayor, in February 1990, a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The East-West Roundtable sought to address numerous challenges generated by the end of the Cold War including the democratization of the media landscape in Central and Oriental European countries. However, no final text was adopted despite the participation of several journalists from Soviet Block, Europe and North America. Some African diplomats who attended the East-West Roundtable had asked the Director General that a similar conference be held on their continent, leading to the Windhoek seminar next year. At the 26th session of the General Conference in November 1991, the Member States of UNESCO expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the Windhoek seminar and invited the Director-General 'to extend to other regions of the world the action is taken so far in Africa and Europe to encourage press freedom and to promote the independence and pluralism of the media; (b) to celebrate the anniversary of the Windhoek Declaration adopted on 3 May 1991; (c) to transmit to the United Nations General Assembly the wish expressed by the Member States of UNESCO to have 3 May declared 'International Press Freedom Day.'",The East-West Roundtable sought to address numerous challenges generated by the end of the Cold War including the democratization of the media landscape in Central and Oriental European countries.,The World Press Freedom Day is celebrated every year on May 3 owing to a proclamation by UN General Assembly in December 1993 following a recommendation adopted at UNESCO's General Conference in 1991.
"Nine years of the Modi government has rid India of its colonial insecurities and finally given us Purna Swaraj (complete independence). It's no coincidence that Modi's India is often referred to as 'Naya Bharat' i.e. New India. It is only over the last nine years that we, as a country, have been able to shed the remnants of our colonial past. Though India gained dominion status at the behest of our freedom fighters on the brink of August 15, 1947, for a long, long time, the remnants of colonisation stayed put in our policies, our minds, our confidence and in the soul of our nation.When we begin to think about why, we begin to understand that it is the predominant leadership which governed India — the new Congress party — split multiple times from its pre-independence self and its 'owners' — the Nehru family — which kept independent India separated from its flaming and living civilisational roots. It is no secret that the Nehrus, past and present, are a clan of anglophiles. This has been documented several times in primary resources from folks who were closely related to them. They never believed in the idea of a glorious India of the pre-colonised era. Instead, they chose to take India on a path which closely mimicked the British one. Here lies the fundamental problem — they are a sect which chose to equate modernism to Western influences when instead, it is the ancient Indian civilisation which was truly the most evolved and advanced in the world — a golden spot which was repeatedly conquered by several external forces for the advancement of their own lands. And yet, the post-independence Congress resented the idea of reuniting the pre-colonised Indian civilisation with post-independent India.Out of the 75 years of independence, the Nehru family has directly or indirectly ruled the country for over 55 years. Either they have been in power directly or have placed officers at senior levels in all institutions such that even during the odd years before 2014, when the Congress was not directly in power, institutions would work at their behest. Most policies prescribed during the consecutive reign of the Nehru family and their coterie have had an essence of a lingering colonial hangover. Let's take for instance the licence-permit raj which they ran under the name of 'socialism'. In the truest sense, it was nothing but an instrument to keep businesses and industries servile and extort money from them in exchange for licences and permits which they would dispense as per their wishes. If enough suitcases of cash made it to the Nehru family's or their party's treasure chest, businesses and industries would be spared from strangulating over-regulation.The Nehru family believed, certainly until 2014, and perhaps even today, that they are the rightful rulers of India — that the right to rule over the country is theirs and theirs alone. And, by that right, they are free to siphon off as much wealth from India into their coffers in other countries as they please to. Due to this mentality, they haven't really gotten around to really forming policies which truly put India on an accelerated path of growth. The idea of maintaining democratic values is foreign to them. Why else would one of their own not only ban the press but also elect a chief justice of their liking, going over the heads of those in line; extend her government's term by force, in the hope of never being thrown out of power. If the family truly believed in democratic values, they would first demonstrate them within party institutions — all of which are controlled directly and indirectly by the Nehru clan.It is only after 2014 that India truly saw what it was to be led by an individual who has been loyal to the land and proud. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ignited a flame of self-assurance and confidence, which the country simply didn't have, owing to the constant debilitating rule by the Nehru family. For six decades we were made to feel that we were simply not 'good enough' or 'wealthy enough' to make rapid progress. It is now that we see that it is the political will which was lacking, for advancing us and giving us the rightful place on the world stage. Just over the last nine years, we have gone from 11th ranking economy to becoming the 6th largest, soon projected to become the 3rd largest over the next five years.Several noted intellectuals have often said that it is with wealth that social indicators such as healthcare and education are markedly improved. Until 2014, we were made to believe that we are 'poor' because we are not educated enough, or that our healthcare spend pushes us into poverty. It is now, that we see, that with the rising status of the country, our children have an equal opportunity in education and we have an equal opportunity in availing good healthcare. With wealth creation and stable, sound policies over the last nine years, there has been an influx of businesses and foreign investment in India. In addition to our domestic companies witnessing unprecedented growth, these offer a platter of note-worthy employment opportunities for young Indians.It is only after nine years of the Modi government, that it is now commonplace to see a 'reverse brain-drain phenomenon', a homecoming of sorts, of the best Indian minds who had left the country for better opportunities abroad. It is only after nine years that an increasing number of global manufacturers want to 'Make-In-India' and an even larger number want to 'Invest in India.' India is truly the bright spot in today's world, as per the International Monetary Fund, and all credit goes to the nine years of the Modi government. We can confidently say that we have broken the shackles of intellectual insecurities, freed ourselves from the colonial hangover and now are well on our way to Purna Swaraj.The writer is a policy and communications strategist.

"The first smartphone with 26GB RAM is coming next month, and we can't believe where the industry is going with these numbers. As per reports coming out this week, Infinix could be the brand which could bring this offering with its yet-to-launch Infinix GT 10 Pro model. The phone is expected to carry design elements such as transparent design which might remind you of the Nothing Phone series. Infinix is likely to use the GT branding for its gaming phone series, which explains the interest in the higher RAM battle. We have already seen a 24GB RAM phone launch in the market, courtesy Nubia, but Infinix could take that laurel by having a wider launch plan for its GT 10 Pro model. And that's not all, Infinix is also likely to bring this device with support for 240W wired charging speed, which is another first for the industry. Reports also say the top-end variant of the Infinix GT 10 Pro will get 26GB RAM and pair it with 512GB storage. The company is usually known for its value-for-money devices but lately, it has gone out of its comfort zone to launch some interesting devices that focus on high-end tech without costing a bomb. But like we have said before, most phones need 12GB RAM at best to utilise the apps available, so having more than double of that doesn't really make a difference, especially when you talk about the performance. Having said that, this memory could be paired with the MediaTek Dimensity 8050 chipset, which is not exactly a high-end chip, which suggests the brand has a slightly different take with its phone and its focus. The GT 10 Pro is likely to have LED lights at the back aka Nothing Phones, and it is possible the brand could opt for RGB lighting instead of white LEDs. The company sells its phones in India and we can't rule out them from bringing the GT 10 Pro to the market, where it should be available for Rs 30,000. We are eager to see if these specs truly work out and if so, how much does the device cost for the buyer.",The new phone could borrow its design element from the Nothing Phone series with its transparent back and also support ultra-fast charging.,The phone is expected to carry design elements such as transparent design which might remind you of the Nothing Phone series.

"From schizophrenia to cancers, haemorrhoids, auto-immune conditions, depression, and more - the Ministry of AYUSH has selected six specialities to integrate with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) across India, News18 has learnt.Once set up, the patients will either come directly to the registration counter or via online registration apart from the reference from the existing outpatient department (OPD) or admitted patients in the same hospital.The move is driven by the central government's announcement in February where it unfolded its plan for setting up a separate wing for integrative medicine, calling it an approach that combines conventional medicine with traditional treatments, in all the medical colleges and hospitals.On the same lines, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of AYUSH are working on having a separate department for integrative medicine in all AIIMS.The draft plan, accessed by News18, says that the concept of the project is 'quite unique'.The Ministry of Ayush has requested space for the faculty and outpatient department (OPD) setup along with a 30-bedded in-patient department (IPD) facility, space for an ayurvedic pharmacy, mini-operation theatre, and yoga hall.It has also asked for the record room, research laboratories, and diagnostic instruments which are available with AIIMS but should be utilised by the AYUSH wing.According to the document, the objective of integrating AYUSH with AIIMS is 'to provide integrated management of the patients with a holistic approach which includes bio-purification (Panchakarma), diet and lifestyle management (swasthavritta), yoga and meditation, kshar sutra (para surgical treatment) and other relevant therapies of Ayush system.The proposed project cost is about Rs 5.74 crore for each AIIMS where the total annual recurring financial implication for integrating alternative medicines is Rs 3.49 crore.Areas where AYUSH can help AIIMSAYUSH is an acronym for traditional and complementary systems of medicine followed in India, namely Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa, and Homoeopathy.The speciality-wise diseases which are under consideration for integration into AIIMS, as per the document, are divided into six therapeutic areas.For instance, under 'chronic diseases', the ailments where AYUSH can be integrated include neurological disorders, chronic kidney diseases, cancers, autoimmune disorders, allergic disorders, skin disorders, etc.In another category, 'bio-purification or Panchakarma', diseases such as chronic musculoskeletal disorders, arthritis, sports injuries, and neurological disorders can be managed.Under 'anorectal surgery or Kshara-sutra', haemorrhoids, fistula and fissures can be managed, the document listed.Similarly, it can be integrated for 'preventive medicine' in managing lifestyle disorders such as diabetes, obesity and hypertension.The fifth category is 'mental health or manas roga' which pitches to manage anxiety, depression, chronic stress, and schizophrenia among other diseases.Another area where AYUSH can be integrated is 'mother and child care', where it can be used to manage antenatal care, postpartum maternal care, respiratory allergic disorders among children, autism and others.Work in progress between both ministriesUnder the objectives, the document said that the centre will provide ample opportunity for research to both fraternities - AYUSH and allopathy.'The project will provide a great opportunity for all the employees to learn because of so much exposure,' it said while adding that the project will provide more job opportunities for the younger generation.The role of the Ministry of Ayush, according to the document, will be to provide technical support to the health ministry for establishing the AYUSH wing and developing academic programmes like PhD.","The Ministry of AYUSH has requested space for the faculty and outpatient department (OPD) setup along with a 30-bedded in-patient department (IPD) facility, space for an ayurvedic pharmacy, mini-operation theatre and yoga hall",
"Elderly population eligible for Covid-19 booster shots, also known as 'precautionary doses', would require a medical certificate to take the dose, Dr RS Sharma, chief executive officer at National Health Authority who also heads the functioning of CoWIN platform, told News18.com. In a surprise address on Christmas, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India would start giving the third 'precautionary dose' to healthcare and frontline workers and those above 60 with comorbidities from January 10. He also announced vaccination for children aged 15-18 from January 3.'Eligible elderly would require a medical certificate to prove their comorbidity. We will follow the same list of comorbidities that was released during the launch of vaccination drive for people between 45 to 59 years of age,' Dr Sharma told News18.com. 'The process remains the same as it was earlier but for another age-group.'Sharma is credited with making CoWIN, the software which is known as the backbone of India's Covid-19 vaccination drive. The government will be allowing booster doses on the basis of specified 20 comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, stem cell transplant, kidney disease or on dialysis, cirrhosis, cancer, sickle cell disease, and current prolonged use of steroids or immunosuppressant drugs. The certificate of comorbidity, signed by any registered medical practitioner, can either be uploaded on Co-WIN 2.0 by the beneficiary while self-registering or a hard copy can be carried by the beneficiary to the vaccination centres.Sharma told News18.com that the process of registration remains simple for children. 'Anyone from the eligible age group can register on Co-WIN and schedule their shots.'

"Apple Arcade is a largely unique game subscription service, which seeks to offer an unlimited, ad-free gaming experience on iPhones - for a monthly fee. Its satisfactory collection has plenty of titles across genres. However, when it comes to sports games, the collection on Arcade is fairly limited - in comparison to others. Interestingly, the sports games that Apple Arcade does offer bring an interesting mix of engaging gameplay and flagship grade graphics. On this note, here are our picks for the best sports games to play on iPhones and iPads, via Apple Arcade.NBA 2K21In our review of Apple Arcade as a service in India, we noted NBA 2K21 as one of its best games, and how games like these are exactly what it needs in order to gain greater popularity. NBA 2K21 brings a very console-esque gameplay experience to iPhones and iPads, producing rich graphics, discernible player faces, and fun, end-to-end short matches - exactly how you'd want sports games to be. All of this makes 2K21 one of the poster titles for Arcade.The Arcade gaming service can be a major hit if Apple ropes in a few more big names akin to NBA 2K21. (Image: Shouvik Das/News18.com)There are the few odd glitches in the game, such as players merging into each other while animating on the sidelines, and an audience that looks very evidently fake. The controls aren't exactly the best, either, and takes a while to get used to. However, once you do, the gameplay picks up. Matches aren't particularly easy to play, but that's a good thing - and the fact that you get the entire game minus annoying popups, thanks to Arcade, makes the experience even better.All things considered, NBA 2K21 is hands down the best sports game to play on Arcade, and in fact, is one of the best games on Arcade. It is also one of the best overall sports games to play across any mobile platform.Super Stickman Golf 3+A surprisingly engaging game, Super Stickman Golf 3+ gives you bizarre putting greens. It compels you to think of the physics behind every stroke, and soon you will find yourself engrossed on how to bounce the ball off the right edges to get a hole in one. As you play more, you proceed to unlock various abilities such as shot trajectory projection. Don't be fooled, though - each course continues to get increasingly difficult as you level up, meaning that you will need the special abilities and better clubs to reach higher levels.Super Stickman Golf 3+ on Apple Arcade is good fun, and is surprisingly addictive. (Image: Shouvik Das/News18.com)Without taking racing games into account, Super Stickman Golf 3+ is our second favourite from the sports bucket, and is also possibly the one Arcade game that we've spent the longest time playing. It is fun, simple and very easy to get used to. It doesn't need you to be too invested in storylines, rivalries or any other element of the sort, making it a perfect game to play on the move as well.Skate CityBefore beginning, I'll admit that I'm not particularly a big fan of skating. Naturally, I had my scepticism behind Skate City. What drew me to it is probably its graphics, and how it gives a feeling of zen. It's not a high octane, adrenaline rushing, skating rink title. Instead, it is an infinite side scroller that you can play for hours - aided by the soothing music, the muted colour palette and pleasant, classy visuals.Skate City on Apple Arcade offers pleasant visuals and zen aesthetics. (Image: Shouvik Das/News18.com)What's great about Skate City is how even without the threat of a competition, you feel drawn to its pleasant gameplay aesthetics. On the way to your skating glory, you unlock some of the world's most iconic cities, which sees the background colour palette alter as you level up. Each city has a signature style, and Skate City captures this in a rather calm and collected manner. There's also a 'Challenges' mode that you can play to tick off objectives, earn stars and upgrade both your character and your board.In a limited sports collection on Arcade, Skate City joins SSG3+ and NBA 2K21 in being three of the outright best games to play via the subscription service - even beyond sports. They also serve as the kind of sports games that Apple should get more of for Arcade, in order to capture the fancy of a wider audience. Until they do, the above three are must-plays for your iPhone and iPad.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and Ukraine-Russia War Live Updates here.","Apple Arcade has a one of a kind smartphone gaming experience, and comes with a number of super interesting sports games to play. Here are our picks.",
"References to freedom fighter and India's first education minister Maulana Abul Kalam Azad have been removed from the new class 11 political science textbook by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).As part of its 'syllabus rationalisation' exercise last year, the NCERT, citing 'overlapping' and 'irrelevant' as reasons, dropped certain portions from the course including lessons on Gujarat riots, Mughal courts, Emergency, Cold War, Naxalite movement, among others from its textbooks.The rationalisation note had no mention of any changes in class 11 political science textbook.The NCERT has, however, claimed that no curriculum trimming has taken place this year and the syllabus was rationalised in June, last year.'Certain changes not finding mention of in the rationalised content book could be an 'oversight',' NCERT Director Dinesh Saklani reiterated.In the class 11 political science textbook's first chapter, titled 'Constitution - Why and How', a line has been revised to omit Azad's name from the constituent assembly committee meetings.The revised line now reads, 'Usually, Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, Sardar Patel or BR Ambedkar chaired these Committees.' In the tenth chapter of the same textbook, titled 'The Philosophy of the Constitution', the reference to Jammu and Kashmir's conditional accession has also been deleted.'For example, the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Indian union was based on a commitment to safeguard its autonomy under Article 370 of the Constitution,' says the dropped paragraph.Last year, the Ministry of Minority Affairs had discontinued the Maulana Azad Fellowship, which was launched in 2009, and provided financial assistance for five years to students from six notified minorities.'Gandhiji's death had magical effect on communal situation in the country', 'Gandhi's pursuit of Hindu-Muslim unity provoked Hindu extremists' and 'Organisations like RSS were banned for some time' are among the texts missing from the class 12 political science textbook for the new academic session.The portions referring to Gujarat riots have also been dropped from class 11 sociology textbook, months after NCERT removed the reference to the 2022 communal violence in two class 12 textbooks.Read all the Latest Education News here","The NCERT has, however, claimed that no curriculum trimming has taken place this year and the syllabus was rationalised in June, last year","In the class 11 political science textbook's first chapter, titled 'Constitution - Why and How', a line has been revised to omit Maulana Abul Kalam Azad's name from the constituent assembly committee meetings."

"Amazon today announced that it will start making its TV streaming device including the Fire TV Stick in India this year via a unit of Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn. The Fire TV Stick will be made by Foxconn subsidiary Cloud Network Technology in the southern city of Chennai, marking Amazon's first foray into having one of its devices manufactured in India. Amazon said hundreds of thousands of Fire TV Sticks would be produced per year, helping it meet the demands of Indian customers.'Amazon will continuously evaluate scaling capacity to additional marketplaces/cities depending on the domestic demand,' the company said in a blog post. The launch of conglomerate Reliance's telecoms venture Jio in 2016 began an era of cheap data tariffs in India, aiding the growth of video and audio streaming services such as Amazon's Prime Video and Netflix. That created a market for streaming devices such as the Fire stick.Seattle, Washington-based Amazon's move to make the device in India coincides with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's big policy push to make the country a hub for electronics manufacturing to compete with other Asian nations such as China and Taiwan, and create jobs.New Delhi's local manufacturing drive has attracted iPhone makers Foxconn and Wistron to expand in India, and another key contract manufacturer Pegatron has also set up base in the country. It has also helped India become the world's second-biggest mobile maker.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here","Seattle, Washington-based Amazon's move to make the device in India coincides with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's big policy push to make the country a hub for electronics manufacturing to compete with other Asian nations such as China and Taiwan, and create jobs.","Amazon said hundreds of thousands of Fire TV Sticks would be produced per year, helping it meet the demands of Indian customers."

"World Bank President Ajay Banga on Sunday said there is a need to replicate the 'Control and Command Centre', also called 'Vidya Samiksha Kendra', in Gandhinagar in Gujarat in not just other parts of the country but also the world as a model of leadership.Banga along with the United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen visited the centre, which gathers and analyses academic and administrative data of 11.5 million students, nearly half a million teachers, and 50,000 schools across Gujarat.Secretary Yellen said the focus on education is core to break the cycle of poverty and to foster sustainable development, adding that the centre 'points to the best of what the World Bank and other development partners can deliver from smartly designed projects with tangible outcomes and spur further innovations'.'The best way to be effective is to take a good idea that works and replicate it. I am very keen that ideas like this are taken across the country, and of course that requires the country to work with us. But I am also keen to take it outside the country and show this as a model of leadership elsewhere,' Banga told reporters.Banga said the centre can be highlighted as an example of how to make development happen with a country with a large young population.India has more young people than any other country and they would its demographic dividend if they get good education, health care, air, and water, Banga asserted.Banga said he will be visiting New Delhi in a few days and will tell Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their meeting that he thinks this control and command centre is a great idea that can be put in other places in India and abroad.Addressing a joint press conference, Yellen said the success of this programme has spurred the government to replicate it in other states.Both the leaders understood the functioning of the centre and interacted with the staff, beneficiary students and parents as well as teachers. They took questions from the children, many of whom wanted to know about the dignitaries' childhood, likes and dislikes etc.The 'Vidya Samiksha Kendra' project has been hailed by the Union government for boosting attendance, decongesting schools, and improving student-teacher ratios.The Union government plans to replicate the success of the project, which is co-financed by partners including the World Bank and the Gujarat government, in other states.","Banga along with the United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen visited the centre, which gathers and analyses academic and administrative data of 11.5 million students, nearly half a million teachers, and 50,000 schools across Gujarat.","World Bank President Ajay Banga on Sunday said there is a need to replicate the 'Control and Command Centre', also called 'Vidya Samiksha Kendra', in Gandhinagar in Gujarat in not just other parts of the country but also the world as a model of leadership"
"Indian Americans, with their hard work and entrepreneurship, have powered the economic growth of the United States and helped forge cultural dynamism in the country, Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden said on Tuesday. Addressing a national virtual fundraiser organised by Indian Americans, Biden assured the community members and the mega donors that as a president, he would address their concerns with regard to H-1B visa and legal immigrants that attract the best and the brightest to the US.Think about what this community has done for the country, he said. Entrepreneurs running businesses around the country and around the world, innovators who make the foundation for Silicon Valley and lead some of the most influential companies in the world come from the community, the former vice president said. 'You have helped forge an economic and cultural dynamism in this country. That is a continuation of who we are, we are a nation of immigrants,' Biden said.Hitting out at President Donald Trump, he said all the harmful actions on H-1B, racial injustice or climate crisis are a common threat. 'This president makes things worse, not better,' Biden added. It makes parents wonder whether their kids will have the kind of future they dreamed of when they came here, he said.'As president, I promise I am going to draw on the best, not the worst, beat this pandemic and build the economy back, help our kids get a good education and make sure healthcare is a right not a privilege, and build an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values,' Biden said. 'We do not talk enough about how the Indian American community has powered our economic growth,' the former vice president said in his address to the virtual fundraiser, which according to his spokesperson Remi Yamamoto was attended by 268 people.Highly appreciative of the cultural, social and family values of Indian Americans, Biden said that is why he values the Indian American Diaspora so much. Seema Sadanandan, a senior policy adviser to the campaign, opened the fundraiser and asked Dr Vivek Murthy, former surgeon general, to start off by talking about his relationship with Biden. Family was the main theme of the conversation with a few references thrown in about Indian food.'Joe Biden is the kind of guy I would love to bring home to have dinner with my mom and dad,' Murthy said in his opening remarks, adding that some homemade masala dosa would be served. 'He is authentic. He is real. And he says what he thinks and that is something I really love about him. He says what is on his mind. He is honest and true,' he said.Biden, Murthy said, is a man who generally meets with his values and those values are reliably centred around generosity and community. 'It is who he is,' Murthy said. In a statement, Ajay Jain Bhutoria, Asian American Pacific Islander Leadership Council and National Finance Committee member of the Biden campaign, said the former vice president will bring hope, unity, change and healing to the country.'He will restore the soul of America and its glorious position on the world stage. He will be the best friend of India and Indo-Americans. He will streamline H1Bs, remove green card backlogs, sign new trade deals, implement climate change agreements, protect us against hate crimes, guard our places of worship and ensure that South Asians are well represented in his administration,' Bhutoria said.","Joe Biden assured the community members and the mega donors that as a president, he would address their concerns with regard to H-1B visa and legal immigrants that attract the best and the brightest to the US.",
"Samsung has such a big first mover advantage that the company is able to command the attention of tech giants for exclusive features for their line-up of foldable phones. It is something we had noted in our review of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G foldable phone a few weeks ago. Samsung confirms that the two latest foldable Android phones, the Galaxy Z Fold3 5G and Galaxy Z Flip3 5G officially get access to exclusive functionality and usability options with popular apps including WhatsApp, Spotify, Microsoft Teams, Gmail and Google Chrome, to name a few. This is in line with Samsung's promise prior to the launch of this year's foldable phone line-up and that popular apps from Google and Microsoft will be able to take advantage of the larger foldable screen as well as functionality including flex mode and S Pen.This year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G is the first foldable in the world to get the stylus functionality, with the S Pen. Part two of that is the fact that popular Microsoft apps including Teams, Outlook and Office come bundled with the Samsung Galaxy Z foldable phones. That has allowed Microsoft to integrate that into the Microsoft Teams Whiteboard on the phone, for better classroom and meeting collaboration. This follows the promise of making Outlook behave more like the desktop version on the large foldable screen complete with the dual pane layout, as well as new functionality for Microsoft Office and updates to the presentation mode in Microsoft Teams.Popular instant messaging app WhatsApp has given the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G the first access to the feature that finally unlocks the ability to switch WhatsApp chats between an Android phone and an Apple iPhone. This means any iPhone user who wants to switch to Samsung's latest foldable phones can now move their chats across platforms. Other Samsung Galaxy phones will soon get this functionality. The Facebook-owned WhatsApp says other Android phones and indeed the Apple iPhone will get access to the chat transfer feature in the coming weeks.Music streaming app Spotify has a goodie in store too. If you are a Spotify subscriber—and this is a good enough reason if you already aren't—using the app on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G enables a new wider layout and improved look as well as accessibility. This interface is designed specifically for the two different foldable phone form factors, and isn't the standard interface stretched to fit these screen sizes better.Google has also given multiple apps enhanced feature set for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G. The Gmail and Google Duo apps are getting the flex mode for group calls and you can also send emails from the main screen. With Google Chrome, Google Maps and YouTube, the updates now offer quick switching between the cover display and the main foldable display, including multi-windows for web browsing on the larger foldable screen.During our reviews of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G, we had noted in elaborate detail the changes that Microsoft and Google in particular were implementing exclusively for these foldable phones. 'Compared with the first-generation Samsung Galaxy Fold, we are already significantly better off with apps now more receptive to this screen size, aspect ratio and that you can have sharing the 7.6-inch display real estate too. Yet, what immediately stands out for this generation is the promise that Microsoft and Samsung are indeed working to add even more. Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Office will get to use this screen size and functionality better. For instance, Outlook will behave more like it does on your desktop, using the dual-pane mode to give you half of the screen space for reading an email and the other half for previewing other mails. Similarly, dragging and dropping stuff between Office apps will become easier, and you'll also be able to run two instances of Word or Excel or PowerPoint, for instance. At the same time, Google has optimized Duo and added Flex mode for YouTube too. If you aren't getting these changes now, you'd get these in the coming weeks,' we had observed at the time.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and Ukraine-Russia War Live Updates here.","Microsoft, Google, WhatsApp And Spotify have unlocked exclusive features and user experience elements for Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G foldable phone users.",
"Bollywood cannot pretend to be naïve, let alone utterly innocent or unaware of the hidden or not so hidden messaging of its themes, images, or lyrics. Take the recent controversy over the song, 'Besharam Rang', from the yet-to-be-released film Pathaan. The movie, starring Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone, scheduled for release on 25 January 2023, the eve of Republic Day, already finds itself embroiled in a maelstrom of outrage.The title itself, in typical Bollywood style, stereotypes an entire community. You don't have to refer to Zanjeer (1973) or, more recently, My Name is Khan (2010), or even to see the movie itself to guess that the stereotype is most likely positive. Yes, Bollywood cannot as yet dare to do a film on the horrors unleashed by the Taliban. While we are still guessing at what actually happens in Pathaan, the story line, from what one gathers, seems a rehash of Ek Tha Tiger (2012). Another spy thriller from the same production house, Yash Raj Films.This is hardly surprising because nothing g is really new in Bollywood. Most films are based on some well-worn and time-tested 'formula.' Both Ek Tha Tiger and Pathaan have Indian intelligence officers, played by Salman and Shah Rukh Khan, who must be shown as utterly loyal to India. In the former, however, the lady love, played by Katrina Kaif, is a Pakistani spy. The film ends with the couple disappearing in an apparently Middle Eastern foreign country where they can live and love in peace.But a formula, to succeed, must have some differences too. Else, how to introduce novelty? Tiger's hero was Avinash 'Tiger' Singh Rathore, a quintessential Rajput and thus another Bollywood martial stereotype. The hero of Pathaan is — yes, you don't have to be a genius to guess — a Pathan. His father had rescued a Hindu family during Partition. Now the son serves the Indian state. His significant other, played by Padukone, is not a Pakistani spy this time around, but an Indian police officer.'Besharam Rang', a song from the movie, was recently released, possibly to test the waters and create some publicity. Preferably positive but at least negative publicity, a buzz around the would-be blockbuster before its release. True to expectations, the song has already attracted a ton of controversy, not to mention negative publicity. Even BJP Minister of State for Home, Ajay Kumar Mishra, and UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, have weighed in against it.But isn't it true that when it comes to the movie market, there is, after all, no such thing as bad or too much publicity. At least this used to be the standard assumption, or should I say formula? Well, think again. Times have indeed changed. It is now widely accepted that a certain type of bad publicity can ruin a film, well in advance of its release. Aamir Khan's mega flop, Lal Singh Chaddha (2022) is cited as a prime recent example. It is, arguably, a minoritarian remake of Forrest Gump (1994), subtly even if not overtly anti-Hindu.It also has strange improbabilities and possibly negative stereotypes such as a Sikh graduate of Delhi's prestigious Hindu College being unable to speak any other language than Bollywood pidgin Punjabi. Or his best Army buddy, a stereotypically 'South Indian' man named Bala (or boy), being not only intellectually challenged but multi-generationally obsessed with making men's hosiery. The string of Bollywood flops, with revenue share of more 'authentic' mega hits from beneath the Vindhyas outstripping Bombay cinema, should certainly have been a wake-up call. Perhaps, something is not quite right with Bollywood's 'Ganga-Jamuni' formula?Now let's come to the song itself, starting with its lyrics. The key lines are: 'Hamein To Loot Liya Milke/Ishq Waalon Ne…Nasha Chadha Jo Sharifi Ka/Utaar Feka Hai/Besharam Rang Kahan Dekha/Duniyan Waalon Ne.' A rough and ready translation should suffice: 'We've been looted by love makers…we have stripped and discarded the intoxicant of virtue. The world is yet to see our shameless hue.' As if to forestall any further doubts, the actor croons her 'wrong' intent: 'Hai Jo Sahi Woh Karna Nahin/Ghalat Hone Ki Yehi To Shuruwat Hai.' What is right, that is not done; this is verily the start of being wicked.' Words most parents would find objectionable, especially when it comes to the sexual mores of their wards.Now to the imagery. Some of these lines are pictured on Padukone in a close-to-saffron skimpy dress, which leaves very little to the imagination.True that the film has passed the Indian Censor Board. So why shouldn't the matter rest there? After all, more supposedly obscene songs have been picturised in the past, including Raj Kapoor revealing respectively, although not necessarily respectfully, both Zeenat Aman's and Mandikini's thighs and bosoms as far back as Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978) and Ram Teri Gang Maili (1985). And Kapoor was the doyen of the Hindi film industry, feted by the government-given Dada Saheb Phalke Award.But times, as I said earlier, have changed. The hidden — and not so hidden — messaging of Bollywood has come in for such scrutiny that audiences will read even more into such sensitive scenes, not to mention colours, than ever before. Not only audiences but influencers will also weigh in on these issues, calling for the boycott, as we have seen, of films or even film stars and production houses.What is the way out? When it comes to Pathaan, one damage control mechanism could be to change the colour of Padukone's dress — or should we say undress — in that particular clip. But if it were to be changed, say, from saffron to green, I am sure all hell would break loose. We already have some sections of the Muslim ulema in India complaining that Pathaan insults not just Pathans but Muslims, showing them in a vulgar and unflattering light.Therefore, just changing the colour of one skimpy costume or even offensive lyrics will not probably suffice. The whole 'formula' has come under question. The faintest whiff of anti-Hindu sentiments or implications will not go down well with a much more religiously charged, not to mention awakened, majority in India. If Pathaan flops, I am sure Bollywood will take head. Better late than never?The writer is an author, columnist and professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

"It has barely been a few hours since Google rolled out the first public beta of Android 11, and Chinese smartphone maker Oppo has confirmed that the ColorOS Android 11 Beta version will roll out later this month. That makes Oppo the first phone maker to confirm the Android 11 update for their phones. Oppo says the first ColorOS Android 11 Beta will be available for the soon to be launched Oppo Find X2 smartphone. 'With a user base of over 350 million, ColorOS is one of the key partners for Google globally. Our consumer insights reveal that users find the ColorOS experience closer to stock Android while welcoming additions we customize for ColorOS specifically,' says Manoj Kumar, Senior Principal Engineer, ColorOS, OPPO, in an official statement. 'We work jointly with Google across OPPO devices at the software system level to enrich and empower user experience on Android. A perfect case in example is the CameraX project that we are working with Google on, to enhance camera capabilities and functionality of third-party apps such as Instagram, Snapchat and others,' he says.

"Terming the dengue situation in West Bengal as 'alarming', the opposition BJP on Sunday alleged that the Trinamool Congress government is responsible for it.BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar blamed Kolkata Municipal Corporation Mayor and senior TMC leader Firhad Hakim claiming he has failed to contain the spread of the outbreak.The TMC accused the saffron party of resorting to theatrics and 'cheap politics'.Majumdar, who took part in cleaning a neighbourhood in north Kolkata's Kankurgachi area with other party workers, alleged that the mayor has earned the sobriquet 'Dengue Hakim' for his failure to control the disease.He also alleged the state government of suppressing the real death figure due to the disease 'to hide its failure.' 'So far our information goes, eight-nine deaths, caused by the disease have been reported but the government is concealing that figure,' he said.Several cases of dengue have been reported in Kolkata, and two of them have died, according to officials.Reacting to Majumdar's accusations, Hakim claimed that the BJP leader is busy doing politics over the disease.'The BJP is not concerned about people. It only believes in stunts and media publicity. We are aware of the dengue situation and taking whatever steps are required,' said Hakim, also the municipal affairs and urban development minister.He asserted that dengue cases are reported during the monsoon every year and the situation is under control.Meanwhile, taking a jibe at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her recent claim that dengue is spreading in the state from neighbouring Bangladesh, Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari wondered why doesn't she send a TMC delegation to Dhaka to discuss the issue with 'her friend' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Adhikari said, 'The CM had made such an absurd comment to hide her failure to check the menace.' The health department has said that they are taking all necessary measures to control the outbreak.The health department has also urged people to take precautions to avoid getting infected with dengue. They have advised people to use mosquito nets, wear long sleeves and pants, and keep their surroundings clean.",BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar blamed Kolkata Municipal Corporation Mayor and senior TMC leader Firhad Hakim claiming he has failed to contain the spread of the outbreak,The TMC accused the saffron party of resorting to theatrics and 'cheap politics'.
"OnePlus is going to launch another flagship smartphone this year, and yes, it will be part of the 10 series but reports suggest the company is not going to use the Ultra moniker for it. Instead, we might see the new T-series upgrade from the brand called the OnePlus 10T 5G and it is expected to launch in the second half of 2022. The news comes via a tipster named Max Jambor this week, who also mentioned that OnePlus has flagship aspirations. He also said that OnePlus has started working on the 10T 5G model, which could use the latest hardware in the market from Qualcomm and other additions. Also Read: WhatsApp Will Soon Let You Filter Unread Chats, View Group Poll ResultsOnePlus 10T 5G could be one of the first to use the new Snapdragon 8 Gen+ 1 chipset that was announced a few weeks back. Apart from that, we expect OnePlus to upgrade the charging speed of its upcoming flagship phone from 80W to 150W which we first saw with the OnePlus 10R in the market. OnePlus 10T 5G is likely to feature a 2K AMOLED display, and we are hopeful the company makes design changes to make it look different from the OnePlus 10 Pro smartphone, the current OnePlus flagship phone in the market. Because it is a flagship model, OnePlus will rely on Hasselblad for the tuning of the cameras.

"Pakistan's electronic media watchdog on Sunday banned satellite television channels from broadcasting speeches of ousted prime minister Imran Khan for allegedly making provocative statements against state institutions. He was also warned against criticising ex-army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Major General Faisal Naseer, who is the director-general of counter intelligence at the Inter-Services Intelligence.According to sources at the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), there is a complete ban on Khan's broadcasts now as he was talking against state institutions. The PEMRA order stated that Khan's speeches will not be played live or recorded.In its order, the regulatory body stated that airing 'hateful, slanderous, vilifying and unwarranted statements' against the country's leadership and state institutions is in sheer violation of Article 19 of the Constitution. Khan has made aspersions against the state institutions by levelling baseless allegations of orchestrating a plan to assassinate him.Sources in the PEMRA said the main reason behind the ban was to stop Khan from criticising the army, election commission, former army chief and the chief election commissioner. A message had also been 'conveyed' to Khan not to target institutions and the serving DG-C ISI as well as his sector commanders. The PEMRA said Khan was making baseless allegations and hate speech against state institutions. Airing of such content was likely to 'create hatred among people or was prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order' or was likely to 'disturb public peace and tranquillity' or 'endanger national security' and it is a 'serious violation of Article 19 of the Constitution and Section 27 of PEMRA Ordinance, 2002, as well as the Electronic Media Code of Conduct, 2015', it added.The PEMRA referred to previous directives where all licencees were directed to 'refrain from telecasting any content against state institutions'. It was observed that such content was telecast by TV channels without effective utilisation of time-delay mechanism in violation of provisions of PEMRA laws as well as judgments of the apex courts, the regulator added.The authority also warned TV channels that their licence will be suspended in case of non-compliance. This is not the first time that the PEMRA has banned TV channels from broadcasting Khan's speeches.In August last year, the former cricketer-turned-politician while addressing a public gathering in Islamabad threatened to file cases against top police officials, a woman magistrate and the Election Commission of Pakistan over the treatment meted out to his aide Shehbaz Gill, who was then arrested on charges of sedition.Read all the Latest News here","The former PM was warned against criticising ex-army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Major General Faisal Naseer, who is the DG of counter intelligence at the ISI",
"As many as 101 universities across the country will implement the Four Year Undergraduate Programme (FYUP) from the new academic session starting August this year. While some universities will be starting it for all courses, others plan to launch it for select programmes.According to the University Grants Commission (UGC), while 19 of these are central universities, including the likes of Delhi University (DU) and Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), 42 'deemed to be' universities, 22 state universities and 18 state-private universities have opted for the multidisciplinary four-year degree programme.Also Read- FYUP: How Different is the Programme from 3-Year Undergrad Degree? Will DU Follow New Norms?Among the states, higher education institutions from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Bihar, have opted for the four-year framework. This will allow students to earn credits each year, multiple entry-exits and the option to do a major and a minor in two different disciplines.The framework for FYUP was notified by the higher education regulator last December for all central universities, while states and other private institutions were urged to adopt the programme. However, of the 56 centrally-funded universities, only 19 have opted for it so far while others are yet to implement it.Some of the central universities besides DU and AMU opting for the new framework include Central University of Jammu, Viswa-Bharati, Assam University, Tezpur University, Sikkim University, Maulana Azad National Urdu University, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University and National Sanskrit University, among others. Some of these universities have opted for FYUP for all courses being offered, including vocational courses, while others signed up for select courses, initially opting for Humanities, Commerce and Economics.'Over 100 universities are going to start FYUP this session while others too will join the course by next year, as some of the institutions needed more time to switch to the four-year mode. Also, the number of disciplines in which the four-year programme is being offered will increase by the next session. No state would want its students to lag behind at a time when all others are offering four-year UG course,' said Professor M Jagadesh Kumar, Chairperson, UGC.The FYUP has been formulated in line with the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which has its focus on skill-based education and a multi-disciplinary approach. Under the new framework, each year has been divided into two semesters. If students exit after a year (with 40 credits), they will be given a UG certificate.Those leaving after two years (with 80 credits) will be eligible for a UG diploma, and those after three years (with 120 credits), a Bachelor's degree. Students who leave before three years will be able to rejoin within three years of their exit and will have to complete the degree within a stipulated period of seven years. It is only after they complete four years (160 credits) that students will be eligible for a Bachelor's degree with honours or research.","The Four Year Undergraduate Programme (FYUP) allows students to earn credits each year, multiple entry-exits and the option to do a major and a minor in two different disciplines",

"Foldables are definitely a bigger thing in 2023 than what we saw last year. You have different unique form factors catching the eye, be it smartphones or laptops. Samsung is the undisputed leader in the foldable mobile segment but the PC market is wide open for contenders to show their worth and the value of innovation. Lenovo was one of the brands to enter this space and then we had Asus with its ZenBook Fold 17 OLED laptop that looks to show the virtue of a foldable PC in the future and how it could make the cut. This laptop came out in 2022 but with the advent of foldables about to increase this year, we decided to give the ZenBook Fold 17 a proper chance to see if the hype is warranted. Asus ZenBook Fold 17 OLED Review: What's Cool?The moment you take out the ZenBook Fold 17 OLED out of the box, you realise this device is going to be a handful. Asus has given instructions to use the foldable laptop, how to hold the panel and avoid grabbing it on the screen. The sturdy build quality has become a hallmark of most Asus products we have tested in recent times, and this one is no different. But as you explore the ZenBook 17 Fold OLED, you realise this is a versatile machine. You have the laptop mode (with and without keyboard), desktop mode, tablet mode, reader mode and Extended mode that probably gives you the best use of the foldable screen.Besides all these, you can also use the laptop in its traditional form by attaching the keyboard to the main unitIt is also fairly lightweight at 1.5 kg (1.8 kg with the keyboard) for its dimensions and the military standard grade makes it further reliable.You can use it in a traditional laptop mode with the keyboard dock attached to the screen. You can also use the virtual keyboard to make the best use of the foldable OLED panel. And if that wasn't enough, you can wirelessly connect the keyboard and spread the display to get the best viewing quality thanks to the stand at the back that keeps the screen standing. The keyboard is offered in the box and you need to charge it via a USB C port but the backup is decent. Most of our time we used the ZenBook Fold 17 OLED in the former mode, but even in the regular laptop format the device was easy to use. The 2.5K OLED display spoiled us during our time with the laptop, so much that every other panel we used after that looked washed out and lacking colours. Pair it with the Bluetooth keyboard and you have the ideal desktop pc.Performance is another strong point about the ZenBook Fold 17 OLED powered by Intel Core i7 processor with 16GB RAM and storage of 1TB SSD which helps you with fast system bootup and quick apps startup. We used it as our primary machine for over a week and during our time we barely noticed the system heating up abnormally or the system freezing at any instance. Having all this power was always going to make that happen and we are glad to report a glitch-free experience. The big display is quite a massive unit that allows you dual-screen interface.Asus has mastered displays on its laptops recently but the other point about the company has been its focus on audio. The built-in Harman Kardon speakers live up to their name and most of our testing was done watching movies and shows from the default speaker. Granted, it is not bass heavy but better than most Windows laptops in the market. The most surprising aspect about the ZenBook Fold 17 OLED was its battery life. With all this power and display quality, we were hopeful of 3-4 hours of backup at max. But it seems the display tuning with the hardware has been done in such a way that the battery life is not affected. During our tests we got over 8 hours of runtime which is quite good for a foldable form factor. The bundled 65W charger also delivers a quick return to full power.Asus ZenBook Fold 17 OLED Review: What's Not Cool?The sturdy built quality aside, Asus ZenBook Fold 17 OLED is a foldable laptop and in that mode you have a big piece of machine that looks like a giant in front of the MacBook Air or even Pro. It becomes unwieldy in that mode and strangely even with those dimensions the laptop only features a single USB C port that is used for charging and other purposes. You do have the headphone jack but connecting an external drive (without an adapter) won't be possible, which for a PC is rather limiting. The hinge on the foldable laptop makes it flexibleThe ZenBook Fold 17 OLED is a powerful machine but not suited for gaming. After all, it has a 12th gen Intel Core i7 processor with an integrated Intel graphics card that can handle casual games but nothing fancy like Call of Duty. The keyboard needs to be charged via the USB C port and can be turned off when not in useWindows 11 is powering the machine which in most cases works fine but we noticed that switching between different modes of the laptop is delayed. This suggests Windows has still some way to go before it becomes a viable platform for foldables. The bundled keyboard definitely needs some work and most importantly backlight support. And like we said before, the USB C charging and the power button on the keyboard is hard to remember. At this price, we would have liked to see the keyboard charge wirelessly when attached to the laptop. Asus has priced the ZenBook Fold 17 OLED at a whopping Rs 3,29,999 which might sound like a crazy price but this form factor suggests the company can command a premium. Asus ZenBook Fold 17 OLED Review: What We ThinkAsus has done a commendable job with the first-gen ZenBook Fold 17 OLED that has the biggest 17.3-inch OLED display in the market. The tech is definitely in its infancy but the potential is there and we can see this being a popular option for creators and heavy users who travel a lot. The dimensions have been well managed but nowhere close to making it portable and the lack of ports was annoying. The display is gorgeous, the speaker stands out on its own and the performance is limited to heavy users, just not for gaming. The keyboard feels like an accessory rather than part of the full package and not having backlight support makes no sense. For a price of Rs 3,29,999 this foldable laptop is making the right noises and shows us that PCs in the future can be exciting and not just a piece of hardware.Read all the Latest Tech News here",Asus launched its Foldable laptop in India recently and we tell you if it is worth that mouth-watering price tag.,
"There is a massive demand for Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to join the BJP's election campaign in Karnataka for the upcoming assembly elections. The state unit wants the chief minister to be seen with different candidates at public rallies and the demand may go up now after the police encounter of Asad Ahmed and Yogi's hit slogan of Mitti mein mila denge.News18 has learnt that the BJP state unit has requested at least six trips by Adityanath to the poll-bound state for multiple rallies and road shows. 'Multiple candidates want the UP CM's rallies in their constituencies, especially coastal Karnataka, where Hindutva is a major issue,' said a BJP leader in Bengaluru.Adityanath could, however, make around four trips from the last week of April for about a dozen rallies and road shows in the state. Sources said Adityanath will also be busy in the two-phase urban local body elections to be held in Uttar Pradesh on May 4 and 11.Sources further said the Asad Ahmed encounter case could make Adityanath a big draw, where issues like action against the Popular Front of India (PFI), have been significant in the coastal Karnataka region. Adityanath's strict approach towards gangsters and criminals could make its way into his campaign speeches in Karnataka, which the BJP feels will have good resonance.Another BJP CM who could campaign in a big way will be Himanta Biswa Sarma. Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, an OBC face, will also be doing rallies in Karnataka. Adityanath has emerged to be a successful star campaigner for the BJP in other states and has been extensively used during the elections in Gujarat, Tripura, Uttarakhand and southern states too.Read all the Latest Politics News here",The state BJP wants the Uttar Pradesh CM to campaign in poll-bound Karnataka and the demand may go up now after the police encounter of Asad Ahmed and Yogi's hit slogan of 'Mitti mein mila denge',News18 has learnt that the BJP state unit has requested at least six trips by Adityanath to the poll-bound state for multiple rallies and road shows.

"While travelling down memory lane, we find that there are so many unsung heroes of our pious land, who have contributed towards literary works, music, and freedom struggle, but have remained mostly unknown to the people of this era. One such person is Vaithamanithi Mudumbai Kothainayaki Ammal, whose journey has been full of unexpected struggles and turmoil and her inherent guts to have stood for what she believed in, is commendable.Born in the year 1901, her fate was immediately sealed by her father's friend Sri Srinivasa Appangar, who had named her Kothainayaki after the famous deity 'Andal' and seemed to have promised to take her as his daughter-in-law in the future. Unschooled as a child, she was married at the age of five and a half years to Parthasarathy, a nine-year-old then. Here, I should mention that child marriages were rampant then, and only a few girls had the privilege of having been sent to proper school or home tutored.Kothainayaki Ammal belonged to the no-school category, but her mother-in-law took care of teaching her the Telugu language. She was proficient in chanting 'Thiruvaimozhi' which is a part of Divya Prabandham, a collection of 4000 Tamil verses. She was unlettered but her good fortune was that she got married into a scholarly family that provided her with the right environment for unfolding her creative talents later. Her husband encouraged her to watch plays and dramas so that she was never deprived to know what the outside world was and what it had to offer to society then. She was dreamily, imaginatively, so creative that she had always been good at spinning stories, which she couldn't write on paper because of her being unlettered, a deficiency that was soon taken care of by her neighbour T.C. Pattamma, who taught Kothainayaki to read and write.It was after this that she became unstoppable. Encouraged by her husband, she wrote and published her first play 'Indira Mohana,' in the year 1924, published by Novel Press. Over the next 30 years, she wrote about 115 books under the pen name Vai Mu Ko. As her tryst just began as a writer, in the year 1925, Vaduvur Doraiswami Iyengar, a well-known author then, suggested that she take over the magazine Jaganmohini which he had been running for the past two years. To her credit, within four months of taking over, she had 1000 subscribers. Hailing with a tag 'orthodox Brahmanical family,' others of her clan were so outraged by a Brahmin woman taking over as an editor of a magazine that they burnt copies of Jaganmohini, but in all this, Kothanayaki remained unperturbed, unfazed and unshaken. Such was her dedicated commitment towards an all-encompassing society.Her first novel was 'Vaidehi' which was serialised in Jaganmohini and later brought out as a book by LIFCO publishers who are still publishing books, novels and shlokas. Her second novel was 'Padma Sundaram' which was translated into Malayalam. In her play 'Vatsakumar,' she criticised those who frowned upon the Bharatnatyam form of dance, as an immoral act.Here, I should mention the fact that how writings of authors can have an impact in our society in a good progressive way. A fan of Kothainayaki Ammal, S. Ramanathan Chettiar, a resident of Saigon then, was so moved by one of her novels 'Aparaadhi' which advocated widow remarriage, that he arranged for the remarriage of many widows in his conservative community. Whenever he visited India, he made it a custom to visit Kothainayaki Ammal and buy copies of her novels so that when he returned to Saigon, he could give them to his relatives and friends.Her life completely changed in 1925 when Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba participated in a meeting exclusively arranged for mahilas (women) in the Vasanta Mantapam of Parthasarathy Temple in Triplicane, Chennai. During the course of the meeting, Kasturba appealed to the gathering to generously donate for taking forward the Harijan Service Movement. An orthodox Brahmin woman on hearing these words, came onto the stage, removed all her bangles, ring, nose rings, ear studs and placed them at the feet of Gandhiji.After this, when she went back home which was just 100 meters away from the venue, everyone at home was looking at Kothainayaki Ammal astonishingly, trying to understand and comprehend what had just happened. Even more astonishing fact was that the whole family got convinced and willingly donated their might in the subsequent meetings. Such is her personality.After meeting Gandhiji, she gave up on draping silk sarees and diamonds, and instead took to wearing Khadi. She didn't stop with that and hawked Khadi on the streets of Madras. She gave speeches against British rule and participated in protest marches.Once when Kothainayaki Ammal was shouting slogans in a protest march, the police tried to stop her by dousing her with sewer water, despite that she continued to raise slogans. With the failed attempts of the police force, they arrested her and sent her to the Vellore prison. From jail too, she didn't want her magazine to stop, so she wrote the continuity on scraps of paper and smuggled them out of the prison through her ever-helping husband when he visited her in prison. For the first 13 years, she shouldered the entire burden of running the magazine.She was so talented that with her self-efforts and her keen ear for music, she could compose songs in Telugu and Tamil. She had not only made solo music discs, but along with D K Pattammal, a well-known vocalist of those days, she made three discs under the Columbia label. Her house in Chennai also had eminent Carnatic singers like M S Subbalakshmi and Bangalore Nagaratnammal to have rendered songs. as Mahakavi Bharathi was a big fan of Kothainayaki's renditions. All India Radio was started in 1938 and hers was the first voice heard on the radio. Later, she gave many radio programmes too.Kothainayaki Ammal's experience as a member of the Censor Board, which she held for 10 years, has to be mentioned. She had censored a scene in the film Adhirshtam, but the film got released with the scene sneaked in and without the legitimate cut. She got furious and ensured that the scene was cut with immediate effect. A woman of substance, an extremely avid supporter of social bondages and women's emancipation, she wasn't afraid to tell what was in her mind always. She wrote fearlessly about everything in her magazine Jaganmohini, where she spoke of the social issues in a woven story form, which would eventually reach the readers' hearts and minds and would make the desired impact in their lives. She was against toddy and alcohol consumption.Kothainayaki Ammal was officially recognised as the first Tamilian woman to write a detective novel, but her works were barely documented in Tamil literature. Her magazine raced to the top and became one of the bestsellers too.After the death of Gandhiji in 1948, she started an association called Mahatmaji Seva Sangam, where girls were taught music, dance, public speaking and Hindi. She organised concerts and lectures at the Sangam.She stayed humble and strong-willed all through her life. Darkness crept into her life when her only son died in 1956. It was after this setback that her ever-beating heart decided that she couldn't take it anymore and fell into a pit of never-ending despair. The world bid adieu to this brave blazing light on 20 February, 1960, leaving behind a legacy, incomparable to her stature of being an all-rounder.In the 1900s, it was normal for girls to remain uneducated as there was no awareness of 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao.' They were married at school going age. Kothainayaki Ammal though got married into an orthodox Brahmin family, she was able to do and achieve all these things only because of her husband who held progressive views and helped her in every possible way.All good things in life don't last forever. Ammal's magazine was closed in 1959 and two years after her death, a letter was delivered to her house with no specific address and just read 'Jaganmohini Madras.' The ironical fact is that the existing family members are not in possession of a single copy of her novels and plays, but last seen and heard, copies of 72 Jaganmohini magazine and 65 of her grandmother's novels were at Calcutta Central Library as narrated by her grandson Venkatakrishnan. There is still a small board outside the family's ancestral house in Triplicane, Chennai, which reads 'Jaganmohini,' the only vestige of a once popular magazine, which had been published uninterruptedly for 35 years.The author is Chennai-based advocate.

"OnePlus will be rolling out its new OxygenOS 11 update to all eligible devices soon and it recently gave us an early look at the revamped user interface through a beta update. While the new changes do look appealing and add a modern touch to the OS, a lot of users pointed out resemblances with Samsung's One UI. The smartphone maker has now come up with an explanation giving relevant details and the thought process behind the implementation of the new UI design. According to OnePlus, stock Android is a good starting point but adding more features on top makes the experience far better. One of the most important factors that OnePlus considered while working on the new OxygenOS update is how the increasing real-estate of displays is changing the way we use our phones. 'As screens increase in size, so does the unused white space. We wanted to make the most of that space while keeping the interface easy to use,' said OnePlus in a forum post. With the new OxygenOS 11 update, OnePlus is trying to bring improved user experience and is focusing on one-handed usage on large displays. The company has analyzed how people use phones and looked at anthropometric data to design a UI that should be more comfortable for one-handed use. It doesn't take a scientist to determine that smartphone users tend to hold their phones from the bottom, which means that reaching the lower half of the display is easier compared to the top. 'The updated layout of OxygenOS 11 now moves the touch controls closer to your thumbs for easier access as soon as you open a menu.' Now you may or may not like the way it looks, but it makes a lot of sense and convenient for users. This is also the reason why the new OxygenOS 11 is being compared to Samsung's One UI which includes a bunch of elements that focus on one-hand usage.",The fact that OxygenOS 11 focuses on one-hand usage experience is a big reason for its resemblence with Samsung's One UI.,The company has analyzed how people use phones and looked at anthropometric data to design a UI that should be more comfortable for one-handed use.
"New Delhi: The death toll of the successful encounter of Naxalites by security forces in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli has gone up after two more bodies were fished out of the Indravati River. With this, the official death toll of Naxals now stands at 39, with six more killed in another encounter in region on Monday. Maharashtra Police have termed the operation as the most successful one by any force in Dandakaranya — the liberated zone comprising of Naxal affected districts in Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. ""This is one of the best operations in the last 38 years since the Naxal problem began,"" an elated IG Naxal OPs (Maharashtra) had told News18. As per Gadchiroli police, the two-day-long operation led to the death of at least two Divisional commanders of CPI(Maoist) — Srinivas alias Sinu alias Vijender and Sainath. Srinivas (51), is a resident of Warangal, Telangana and was wanted in 82 cases of murder, abduction and loot. On the other hand, Sainath was a Gattepalli village in Aheri taluka of Gadchiroli and was the local face of the Maoists. He had joined the Maoists in 2004 and was wanted in 75 cases of murder, abduction etc. Both Srinivas and Sainath were members of the Divisional Committee of CPI (Maoist), a top decision-making body of the Naxals. Sources said the two were leading a group of around 60 Naxals from Telangana to Gadchiroli and stopped on the banks of Indravati River in the Tadgaon forest of Bhamragad. Tadgaon is about 750 km from Mumbai and is considered to be a Naxal stronghold. Police believe the Naxals were travelling to extort money from tendu patta dealers. ""At this time of the year, Naxal platoons move from Telangana to Gadchiroli for extortion. Tendu patta dealers are mostly their target,"" a top officer told News18. Preliminary information suggests that the platoon stopped for rest and breakfast. Tadgaon is on the Chattisgarh-Maharashtra border with Indravati River separating Bijapur in Chhattisgarh from Gadchiroli in Maharashtra. Police say they first surrounded the Naxals and warned them to surrender. ""We had a specific tip-off about the group's movement in the area. A combing operation was launched on Saturday. On Sunday, between 10 and 11 am, the Naxals started firing and our boys retaliated killing many,"" IG Anti Naxal ops Sharad Shelar told News18. Sources said two parties of Maharashtra Police's elite anti-Naxal force C-60 were dispatched to Tadgaon. Each party had about 30 highly trained commandos. Firing began from the Naxal side leading to an hour-long gunfight. 'We have not lost any men. It was a successful operation,"" SP Gadchiroli Abhinav Deshmukh told News18. The last of the reports said that Police were carrying the Naxals' bodies to the nearest Tadgaon Thana. Helicopters had been pressed into service to reinforce the forces on the ground where mobile connectivity is poor and hence information outflow is patchy. Maharashtra police suspects that the number of Naxals killed will go up since at least 60 Naxals were part of the group. ""Rains and nightfall forced us to stop looking for more bodies but our operation will resume tomorrow,"" said SP Abhinav Deshmukh. The operation is being hailed by the police as next only to the one launched by Andhra Pradesh's Greyhounds, who killed 24 Naxals in Odisha's Malkangiri in 2016.",Maharashtra Police have termed the operation as the most successful one by any force in Dandakaranya — the liberated zone comprising of Naxal affected districts in Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.,
"At a time when there is a lot of chatter about how secure instant messaging apps are, Apple has updated the Platform Security conversation to give better perspective to how the data on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, HomePod and indeed iMessage, FaceTime, iCloud and Car keys, to name a few apps and services. The iMessage and FaceTime security protocols that are in place are perhaps the most relevant for a lot of users, considering messaging is in focus. Apple iMessage messaging service, at this time, is available across a variety of Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Mac computing devices. FaceTime video and voice calling service is also available across these devices. In a nutshell, and let's just say a spoiler alert in advance, it may just be a case of move over for WhatsApp, Zoom and a lot of other apps and services that deliver on these two use cases.Let us look at how iMessage is secured. Apple clarifies from the outset that they do not log the contents of messages or attachments, and all of these are protected by end-to-end encryption. Just the sender and the receiver can access these messages. Apple cannot decrypt this data, something that has often put the tech giant at loggerheads with law enforcement, particularly in the US. For setting up iMessage, a phone number is verified by the carrier network and the SIM, which often requires an SMS be sent to complete the verification chain. Email addresses can also be used with iMessage, and the iCloud IDs would also be verified by a confirmation link.Apple says that when a user turns on iMessage on a device, the device generates encryption and signing pairs of keys for use with the service. For encryption, there is an encryption RSA 1280- bit key as well as an encryption EC 256-bit key on the NIST P-256 curve. For signatures, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) 256-bit signing keys are used.Every time you want to send an iMessage to a new contact or start a new conversation, your iPhone or iPad or Mac, for instance, would connect with the Apple Identity Service (IDS) to get access to the public keys and addresses for all devices associated with the ID or contact you are sending the message to. This is to enable seamless delivery of iMessage chats to all devices signed in with the same iCloud ID. Any outgoing message is individually encrypted for each of the receiver's devices. These are 128-bit keys, a combination of a randomly generated 88-bit value and a HMAC-SHA256 key to construct a 40-bit value, says Apple.FaceTime voice and video calls also get set up in a similar way, with SIM authentication if needed. All calls as well as audio and video content are end-to-end encrypted. The FaceTime connection is made through an Apple server infrastructure which relays data packets between the registered devices attempting a FaceTime call. The encryption is the AES256 and HMAC-SHA1. Group FaceTime can have up to 33 concurrent participants and all group calls are end to end encrypted.The updated Apple Platform Security takes forward Apple's focus on security and data privacy as the very core foundation of the apps and services that it builds for the iPhone and other devices. The guidelines that are part of the update cover iOS 14.3, iPadOS 14.3, macOS 11.1, tvOS 14.3, and watchOS 7.2 operating systems. 'Apple believes privacy is a fundamental human right and has numerous built-in controls and options that allow users to decide how and when apps use their information, as well as what information is being used,' they say, in the documentation.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here","Apple has updated the Platform Security conversation to give better perspective to how the data on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, HomePod and indeed iMessage, FaceTime, iCloud and Car keys, to name a few apps and services.",

"WhatsApp competitor and encrypted messaging app Signal has announced that it now supports 40 participants on group calls. The company said that it released end-to-end encrypted group calls a year ago, and since then it has scaled from support for five participants to 40. ?There is no off the shelf software that would allow us to support calls of that size while ensuring that all communication is end-to-end encrypted, so we built our own open-source Signal Calling Service to do the job,? the company said in a blogpost.Signal mentioned that when building support for group calls, it evaluated many open sourceASelective Forwarding Unit (SFUs), but only two had adequate congestion control. ?We launched group calls using a modified version of one of them, but shortly found that even with heavy modifications, we couldn?t reliably scale past eight participants due to high server CPU usage,? the company said.To scale to more participants, the company wrote a new SFU from scratch in Rust. It has now been serving all Signal group calls for nine months, scales to 40 participants with ease and is readable enough to serve as a reference implementation for an SFU based on the WebRTC protocols, the company said.Read all the Latest News and Breaking News here","The company said that it released end-to-end encrypted group calls a year ago, and since then it has scaled from support for five participants to 40.","The company said that it released end-to-end encrypted group calls a year ago, and since then it has scaled from support for five participants to 40."

"For many, the curious case of Rahul Gandhi's 'disengagement' with the 'mainstream media' during his mammoth Bharat Jodo Yatra is a case of missed opportunity. In fact, throughout the 19-year-old political stint, Rahul has been arriving early and late on formulating strategies or implementing them. For instance, Rahul spent far too many years between 2006 and 2013, in trying to democratise the Youth Congress and the NSUI. As an unconventional politician, he had fancied himself as a reformer, catalyst, etc, but his act of tearing off a UPA affidavit boomeranged. In the modest opinion of this columnist, the idea of opposing a proposed legislation to allow convicted politicians was not an affront to the good doctor, prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh. It came to haunt Rahul and the Congress as the Gandhi scion failed to keep tainted politicians Ashok Chavan and Suresh Kalmadi out of the list of party nominees for the 2014 Lok Sabha.I have always maintained that the history of the Congress is drastically different from the story of the Congress. Rahul's bid to usher 'newness' in the party was stonewalled from leaders who actually drew strength from his mother Sonia Gandhi. Months before 2014 Lok Sabha, Rahul had deputed Madhusudan Mistry and his team to look for new candidates for 2014 Lok Sabha but a majority of names and recommendations given by Mistry did not even come up for a serious discussion at the AICC's Central Election Committee in the early months of 2014. It is also an open secret that Rahul did not want the party leadership to openly back Mallikarjun Kharge's candidature, but his advice went unattended.Would Bharat Jodo Yatra and the 2024 general elections be further additions in the long list of missed opportunities or the Gandhi scion would turn the tables on critics?Last heard, Team Rahul now wishes to focus on 200 Lok Sabha seats for 2024 that would make or mar the grand old party. There is a growing realisation that a third successive defeat would signal the end of Nehru-Gandhi hegemony and result in 'Janata-Dal-isation' of the Congress. The latest poll survey by a channel and pollster, if the general elections are held today, the BJP would win 284 Lok Sabha seats and that 67 percent of survey respondents were 'satisfied' with the Narendra Modi government's performance regardless of the issues such as lack of jobs, economic crisis, threat from China etc.It is easy to dismiss and even mock the survey and the prime-time news channel, attach motives or even term the mood of the nation as a fictitious exercise. But deep down, are not the Congress leaders of all hues and shades worried, uncertain and nervous about 2024? The survey has predicted 68 Lok Sabha seats for the Congress if the elections are held today. Bizarre and paradoxical as it may sound, but a section of the party leaders and well-wishers consider this as somewhat a comforting figure, and better than their internal assessment which varies between 37 to 50. In 2019, the bulk of the] Congress Lok Sabha seats had come from Kerala [15], Tamil Nadu [8] and Punjab [8]. In 17 states and union territories, the Congress had not even opened its account. Almost in all seats that the Congress won with a margin of over two lakhs and more, these verdicts came from Tamil Nadu and Kerala.As the Bharat Jodo Yatra comes to end, Rahul has consciously avoided giving interviews to the mainstream media, i.e. prime time TV news channels, leading newspapers, regional press and digital platforms. While it is commendable that he held 13 press conferences, fielded all questions, he only gave interviews to influencers and bloggers popular on social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter. This was reportedly an advice tendered by his core team including members of the AICC's communication department. Rahul was even heard saying, 'They [mainstream media] don't want to listen. It is as if they know everything. They have already taken a decision as to what they need to do and what they don't need. So, what's the point of talking to them? But if someone has an open mind, then one can talk to them.'Nothing can be farther to truth than this. Barring a handful of TV news channels and anchors, Rahul's assumption that 'the mainstream media has become an instrument that serves only the interests and destructive ideology of those in power', is inaccurate and exaggerated. My friend and editor in chief of The Tribune, Rajesh Ramachandran's poster in 'An Uncertain March' has gone uncontested. Rajesh Ramachandran has wondered how a mainstream newspaper like The Tribune [I can add 40 more such publications without a hesitation] can be clubbed with some 'repugnant TV anchors for the mainstream.' Rahul's stand also belittles hundreds of media practitioners who have diligently been working at district and state levels.While every politician and public figure is entitled to act as per his/her whims and fancies, parliamentary democracies across the globe have often seen greater interaction between media and the Opposition. During the Emergency years [1975-77], the Indian media had almost joined the opposition ranks that resulted in a crushing defeat of a mighty Indira and her ambitious son, Sanjay Gandhi. The last leg of the UPA too saw a massive mobilisation of media onslaught of sorts against a tottering Manmohan Singh regime. The period had also seen favourable media projection of Anna Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal and other 'India Against Corruption' protagonists.After his long and remarkable foot-march from Kanyakumari to Srinagar, Rahul needs to reflect upon his remark, 'They [mainstream media] don't want to listen…' and check its veracity. He need not go further. The AICC's communication department itself is packed with those having made a successful lateral entry in politics/Congress. In short, are those tendering him advice on media, actual stakeholders in elections and electoral polity? Rahul may find an answer there.The writer is a Visiting Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. A well-known political analyst, he has written several books, including '24 Akbar Road' and 'Sonia: A Biography'.

"Samsung has officially announced that The Frame QLED TV is now going on sale and will be available during the Flipkart Big Billion Days sale which starts this weekend. The company has confirmed the availability of the TV after first unveiling it a few weeks ago. This 55-inch beauty is priced at Rs 84,990 at this time for the Flipkart sale, with further discounts as well on certain payment methods. Samsung says that consumers who will complete pre-paid transaction through credit cards, debit cards and net banking for the purchase of The Frame QLED TV will also get an additional instant cash back of INR 5,000. This means, the effective price of the 55-inch QLED TV goes down to Rs 79,990. Now that is indeed a great price. Samsung The Frame QLED TV remains a part of the lifestyle TV line-up for the company. Yet, there are no compromises on the performance aspect too. The QLED panel has a 120Hz refresh rate and supports HDR10+ high dynamic range (HDR). In fact, this is one of the Netflix Recommended TVs, a badge of honor that doesn't come easily. The display resolution upscaling and image processing is done by the quad core Quantum Processor 4K chip. Since this also runs the same Tizen based smart TV platform as other Samsung smart TVs, expect this to run the standard portfolio of streaming apps as well, including Netflix, Amazon Video and Hotstar. However, it is the design which is the real highlight. In fact, it is designed like a picture frame that you may hang on the wall. Samsung says that The Frame QLED TV has motion and brightness sensors. The motion sensor detects your presence and turns the TV display into artwork, and then turns off to save power when you move away. It also detects the ambient light which then matches the brightness and colour temperature of the display. And that is perhaps why there is an Art Store app that this TV comes with. 'Through the Art Store, you can transform your TV into a picture frame that shows 1,200+ artworks from around the world. Users can get access to a growing library of artwork from world renowned institutions by selecting an individual piece of art for INR 1,199 or subscribe to the full Art Store collection for INR 299 per month,' says Samsung about the subscription service.","If you make a payment using certain methods, there is a Rs 5,000 instant cashback offer as well, which brings the price down to Rs 79,990.","Samsung says that consumers who will complete pre-paid transaction through credit cards, debit cards and net banking for the purchase of The Frame QLED TV will also get an additional instant cash back of INR 5,000"
"On September 30, 1962, US President John F Kennedy sent 3,000 federal troops to protect the lone black man, James Meredith, to study in the all-white University of Mississippi where the racist Governor of the Mississippi state, Ross Barnett, himself stood with his Marshals blocking the entrance of Meredith to the university campus. Such was the determination of JFK to protect the right of one black man that he risked his next presidential bid, which resulted in a violent clash with racist Southern whites, leaving two dead, 160 soldiers injured and 28 US Marshals wounded. Meredith was guarded 24 hours a day by reserve US Marshals and Army troops for him to be educated as any other white citizen. This is an oft-quoted example of the state using its might to protect the right of one individual, the testimony of a strong democracy.When Teesta Setalvad was rejected bail by the Gujarat High Court on July 1, her lawyers reached out to the Supreme Court. Within hours of the Gujarat HC judgement, the SC constituted a two-judge panel, which could not come to a decision and referred the matter to Chief Justice DY Chandrachud who urgently constituted another three-judge panel the same night. This three-judge panel deliberated and granted her interim bail for eight days so that she can apply for bail in the Supreme Court. The judges noted that Teesta Setalvad should not be denied interim liberty even for one day, that she was a lady and entitled to special protection under Section 437 of CrPC.On the surface, this looks like another towering example of the democratic institutions of India standing for the right of one individual. But is it so? If one looks at the plight of an average Indian, especially the weak and the underprivileged, the Setalvad case appears to be one of a privileged citizen. The comments of judges that no one can be denied justice for one day should also be applied to those stuck with five crore outstanding cases in the Indian judiciary and more than four lakhs of undertrials waiting for justice. At least 70,000 of the five crore cases are pending in the Supreme Court alone.Even President Droupadi Murmu made a fervent appeal in the presence of the chief justice that the Indian judiciary needed to address the issue. Former Law Minister Kiren Rijiju pointed out that they work only 193 out of 365 days in a year, which is causing enormous problems for justice seekers. While PILs are signs of democracy where a common citizen can have access to the higher judiciary, when PIL of powerful NGOs and activists (many funded by anti-India international organisations) supersede 70,000 pending cases for decades in the Supreme Court alone, then it begs the question whether democracy is really served, unless perhaps the PIL is put in the queue along with those waiting for justice.But there is a bigger issue at the heart of the Teesta Setalvad case. The case is not a normal one. Her allegations against Narendra Modi, who is the current Prime Minister of India, about his involvement during the Gujarat riots when he was the chief minister of the state, resulted in an investigation by the SC-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) committee, that not only could find even a single charge made against Narendra Modi to be true but also found several serious wrongdoings of Teesta Setalvad.Setalvad is also accused of getting foreign funds such as the Ford Foundation, a known front of the CIA which, along with the USAID, committed many atrocities around the world and has attempted regime changes in more than 60 countries causing devastating consequences. Several Indian news media have reported the CIA's alleged involvement in the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and many Indian space and nuclear scientists.Setalvad's co-accused, RB Sreekumar, is the IPS officer (and AAP leader) who is accused of framing ISRO scientist Nambi Narayan and his fellow scientists with fake espionage charges (believed to be at the behest of the CIA) that stunted the advancement of space technology of the nation for more than a decade. Gujarat HC judge Nirzar Desai himself noted Teesta's bail application case as, 'enlarging a person, who allegedly acted at the behest of a political party, and tomorrow situation may raise that some outside force may utilise and convince a person to make efforts in similar line causing danger to nation or to particular state by adopting same modalities and, therefore, considering the totality of the fact and circumstances as also considering the fact that any such attempts may not take place in future, the bail application is required to be dismissed'. The esteemed judge also noted how giving bail to such individuals will blunt the progress of the nation because such individuals with deep connections will deepen and widen the communal polarisation.This is more pertinent given the open threats of people like George Soros who publicly claimed that he has allocated one billion dollars to do regime change in India so that India can serve Western interests. These regime change operations are extremely sophisticated using a system of exploiting fault lines to create devastation in the target nation as well as awards to powerful members of that nation to influence them.It is not that the Supreme Court is not aware of the case and the observations made by the Gujarat HC. Given the urgency and deliberations of the SC, even while on vacation, make many people wonder if this is a case of uncommon people with uncommon access. At the heart of the issue is accountability and to whom. No democratic institution can be above the will of the people; its power has to be derived directly or indirectly from the citizens of the state.Much debate has been made about India's collegium system of selecting judges, including several comments by Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar (who himself was an advocate and practised constitutional law at SC) and former law minister Kiren Rijiju. The Parliament does not appoint itself, nor does the President or the Prime Minister. They are directly or indirectly elected by the will of the people and their performance is evaluated and voted out by the collective will of the people every five years. There is simply no other democracy in the world where judges appoint themselves. As per a research done by a Mumbai-based lawyer, about 50 percent of the judges of high courts and 33 percent judges in the Supreme Court are family members of those in 'higher echelons of judiciary'.During his address on Independence Day in 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said, 'Unfortunately, the evil of nepotism in the political field has nurtured nepotism in every institution of India. It is engulfing many of our institutions. Because of this, the talent of my country suffers. The strength of my country suffers.'India is at the cusp of its destiny to advance and become a superpower which threatens vested interests, both internally and externally, and it is time we fix our democratic institutions and collectively as a nation, be extremely vigilant.Satya Dosapati is a US-based activist who has played a critical role in the introduction of paper trail for India's Electronic Voting Machines called VVPAT.

"Jamui: The family of a farmer in Bihar's Jamui district has been tormented by local moneylenders for 25 years because he borrowed a sack of wheat and rice to feed them. The story dates back to 1993 when Ramdhani, a resident of Madhopur village under Mathurapur Panchayat of the district, was in a dire need of money and had no option but to seek help from Chandar Das, a local sahukar (money lender). Ramdhani borrowed a sack of wheat and rice and promised to return the price of grain next year with interest. The sahukar demanded Rs 27, 000 for it which Ramdhani is still struggling with. 'Chandar Das kept pressing for the amount and at last took control of my agricultural land measuring three Kathha. Now after 25 years when I requested him to leave the land, I was asked to pay Rs 4.5 lakh against the principal and accrued interest,' Ramdhani said. He sought the help of local panchayat, but that made his problem bigger. The panchayat ruled in favour of the sahukar and ordered Ramdhani to forget the land and register it in favour of Ranjit Das, the son of Chandar Das. Now Chandar has settled outside the state but his daughter- in-law Kanti Devi justified the demand saying, 'We have been saying him (Ramdhani) to register the land for so long. This is not today's story. My father-in-law not only had given wheat and rice but some cash also. How can we leave the land unless he pays our dues? Interest is bound to increase now.' Bihar food supply minister Madan Sahni has assured to intervene and ordered district magistrate Kaushal Kishore to probe the matter. When contacted, Kishore said the circle officer of Sikandara will go to Madhopur village and meet the family of Ramdhani. 'If the land was grabbed illegally then we will take appropriate action,'he said.","Ramdhani borrowed a sack of wheat and rice and promised to return the price of grain next year with interest.

"We are at that stage in the evolution of running shoes that a sub Rs 10,000 price point doesn't guarantee success. Purely because the competition in this price bracket is now more robust than ever before, and no one can rest on laurels and 'value'. This is why the Reebok Forever Floatride Energy (it is a long name for sure) isn't going to glide into the stores and straight into your heart. The latest running shoe from Reebok is a part of their more affordable line, but does it have the style and substance to tick off the checklist? Remember, this comes just after the radical and brilliant Sole Fury line-up. For starters, the Reebok Forever Floatride Energy priced at Rs 9,999 is going into battle against the UA Hovr Sonic2 (around Rs 9,000), the Nike Free RN 5.0 (around Rs 8,000) and the Skechers Go Run 7 (Around Rs 9,000), all of whom are very competent running shoes in their own right. Reebok is jumping into this battle with simplicity as the foundation. A thick midsole cushion, a universally acceptable upper, keep the weight down and good grip levels from the outsole. There are no revolutionary changes, no gimmicks and no claims of revolutionising running shoes. The Reebok Forever Floatride Energy is all about keeping the convention going, and that perhaps helps it appeal to more age demographics than some of the other running shoes claim to redefine the definitions every time a new shoe comes along. From the outset, the design and the bulk of the Reebok Forever Floatride Energy looks like a traditional running shoe. No experimentations with the design of the upper, the thickness of the mid-sole and the lacing systems. Everything is what and where you would expect from a running shoe that doesn't pose a learning curve. This is a good and a bad thing. Good because familiarity is what comforts a lot of people. Yet at the same time, standing still when the rivals are experimenting could be a bit of an issue. The engineered mesh upper fits well around the contours of the foot yet provides enough room and breathing space. The toe box doesn't narrow as much as you might assume looking at the Reebok Forever Floatride Energy from the outside, which is great for the comfort yet. This is a single knit upper which has midfoot reinforcement on the outside and support for the heel. Even if you aren't wearing socks, there are no seams on the inside of this upper that would irritate you. The only real issue with the design is the narrower than usual tongue, and if it slips either side even slightly, you will have the lacing system interacting with your foot at some point. Apart from the visual choice which Reebok has made. The insert at the back of the Forever Floatride Energy, perhaps as a design choice, has been left to look like an add-on. And it does. The dual colour theme is also quite jarring, and not that we haven't seen colour themes working together on running shoes before, this just doesn't feel that pleasing and seamless. That is irrespective of which colorway you pick. I really can't put my finger on it, but something looks odd. Yet you need to remember that even with these overlays, this isn't a heavily reinforced shoe. It is a nice mid-pace runner, and very versatile at other times but if speed is your primary concern, you'll be left wanting more. Slip your foot in, and what sits beneath is a generously thick cushioned midsole. Reebok calls this Floatride Foam, but this is slightly different from some of the more expensive Floatride shoes. This is not Pebax foam, but instead, is expanded polyurethane. Adidas apparently also has a similar material in some of the Boost soles in their shoes, but the Reebok implementation just looks a lot better on the outside as well—not everyone wants their shoes to look like the thermocol from the packaging is still clinging on because you've been absent-minded. Nevertheless, whatever the pedantics of the matter, the similarities do exist. But then again, that could just be me and I really don't know everything. This definitely is also much lighter which runners would appreciate in the long run. It also doesn't feel the same, because it has smaller and denser packaging of the expanded thermoplastic polyurethane (E-TPU) beads which have their own advantages. The primary one being the balance of softness while running. And then there is carbon rubber. The Forever Floatride Energy feels soft and comfortable when you are running without the foot ever feeling isolated or in need of feedback from the running surface. Yet this somehow tightens up when you are not to provide that much more confidence in terms of foot stability, and that is good because the foot doesn't feel like its sunk-in. There is good support for the foot all through, and I did not notice any roll. Reebok hasn't done much experimentation with the outsole on the Forever Floatride Energy which means this is a full-length contact implementation. The grip levels are good though only Father Time will testify to how long this will last of you run on rougher surfaces. There is no doubt that the Reebok Forever Floatride Energy is a great every day running shoe that ticks off the comfort and design checklist. Good grip levels too. But you will be often reminded of the thin tongue, and some may even argue that the collar sits a bit higher than some other running shoes—though this is subjective. At first glance, it doesn't look quite visually appealing. Yet the fine improvements while retaining the conventionality is its strongest point. Reebok has made a fine impression with the Forever Floatride Energy.","Reebok has made a fine impression with the Forever Floatride Energy running shoes, that don't cost an arm and a leg while at it.",

"OnePlus has been keeping its promise of regular software updates that bring features from its latest flagship smartphone to its older phones. As a result, the latest OxygenOS 9.0.7 update has become a fairly significant one in terms of new features rolling out to the company's yesteryear flagships. With the new update, OnePlus is introducing three key new features, which include the Fnatic mode for enhanced gaming performance, a native screen recorder and a new Quick Reply feature. Fnatic Mode has been much hyped since its launch, and is essentially a software optimisation that helps tune the device to maximise its gaming potential. When switched on, Fnatic Mode turns on Do Not Disturb to prevent intrusive notifications (apart from calls/messages from emergency contacts), and handles better process and resource allocation, as well as network enhancements for eSports enthusiasts. This is combined with the new screen recorder, which allows users to adjust frame rate of recording as well, while also recording native audio from the phone. This can be a potentially important feature for gamers, who often resort to rooting devices or using third party tools in order to record their gameplay or stream them live. The third feature, Quick Reply, works in landscape mode, and open up a splitscreen view of the app from which you've received a message, and a floating keyboard to type in quick responses in between gaming. The new features are expected to continue rolling out for the OnePlus 5 and 5T, with features such as DC Dimming and RAM Boost expected to hit the older devices in the near future. OnePlus 5 and 5T are also expected to get Android Q, but it remains to be seen if OnePlus manages to keep its promise and deliver the new Android version in good time.","The new OxygenOS update also brings to the two phones a Quick Reply feature, which helps respond to texts while streaming videos or gaming.","With the new update, OnePlus is introducing three key new features, which include the Fnatic mode for enhanced gaming performance, a native screen recorder and a new Quick Reply feature."

"Bengaluru: As the 13-month-old Congress-JD(S) combine in Karnataka hangs by a thread, DK Shivakumar is the man of the moment. A Congress warhorse, Shivakumar has been deputed to placate rebel MLAs camped in a Mumbai hotel and pull the government out of the current crisis. The Congress leader, however, is no stranger to this role. In 2002, the Congress-led Vilasrao Deshmukh government in Maharashtra was about to collapse. Fearing a defeat, he moved his MLAs to neighbouring Karnataka, ruled by SM Krishna. Krishna entrusted the responsibility of keeping them safe to his young Urban Development Minister DK Shivakumar. He herded them to Eagleton Resort on the outskirts of Bengaluru and hosted them for a week. On the day of trust vote, he escorted them back to Mumbai and the Vilasrao government survived. And Shivakumar hit the national headlines. That incident also helped him cement his relationship with the Gandhi family. Shivakumar, known as DKS in Karnataka politics, is an all-weather man for the Congress. He reached the top of state politics by fighting the Gowda family in their stronghold. His prolonged fight with the Gowdas is legendary. Shivakumar, a Vokkaliga, won his first Assembly election in 1989 from Sathanur in Kanakapura taluk by defeating the giant of Karnataka politics HD Deve Gowda. When S Bangarappa became the CM in 1990, he recognised Shivakumar's talent and made him a junior minister with Prisons and Homeguards portfolio. Even though the portfolio was insignificant, Shivakumar caught the attention of the top brass because of his leadership skills and daring. He was just 29 years old and that mattered a lot. When Deve Gowda-led Janata Dal came to power in 1994, Shivakumar was one of the very few who survived the storm. He fought a battle with the Gowdas even when Deve Gowda was the PM. When a fellow Vokkaliga, SM Krishna, became the CM in 1999, he made Shivakumar his Urban Development minister. Shivakumar behaved like de-facto CM, rubbing many top leaders the wrong way. In the 2002 Lok Sabha bypolls, he fought against Deve Gowda from Kanakapura and lost. He took his revenge by defeating Deve Gowda in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls from the same seat by fielding a journalist, Tejaswini, against him. But the Krishna government lost the Assembly polls held along with Lok Sabha polls. Congress and JD(S) formed a coalition government and Shivakumar was kept out. He had to wait till January 2014 to return to Karnataka Cabinet. He had held the post of KPCC working president during Yeddyurappa's government. But he was ineffective as the head of Congress. When Siddaramaiah-led Congress came to power in 2013, Shivakumar was kept out on charges of corruption. But he did not quit the party or say anything against the high command. He was made the Power Minister in January 2014. Even though he never shared a good rapport with Siddaramaiah, they stuck together because of their common enemy — the Gowdas. There was the occasional bickering, but they worked together. When the BJP tried to defeat Sonia Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel in the Gujarat Rajya Sabha election in August 2017, the same Shivakumar had sheltered Gujarat Congress MLAs. He was raided by the Income Tax and ED, but he did not budge. Ahmed Patel won and Shivakumar had the last laugh. He missed the chance to become KPCC president in May 2017 because Siddaramaiah saw him as a threat. But he did not utter a word against the party or Siddaramaiah. He was the campaign committee chairman during the last election. After the elections delivered a fractured mandate, the same Shivakumar joined hands with the Gowda family to keep the BJP out of power. He had kept them at the same Eagleton resort for three days and later took them to Hyderabad by bus. He made sure that no Congress MLA switched sides and even brought two 'missing' MLAs — Pratap Gouda Patil and Anand Singh — back into the party. Shivakumar is liked and hated in equal measures. He is a polarising personality but his supporters love and admire him because they claim he stands by them during crisis. His enemies fear him because he is vindictive. He makes no bones about his ambition to be the chief minister of Karnataka before he retires from politics. Speaking to this reporter, he had said that he had won seven Assembly elections in a row and had done a lot for the party which makes him eligible for the post. And most agree with him.","A Congress warhorse, Shivakumar has been deputed to placate rebel MLAs camped in a Mumbai hotel and pull the government out of the current crisis.",

"The topic of this article is a bit unusual and not one of my routine focus areas such as security, foreign policy, and diplomacy. However, in the intuitive crevices of my subconscious mind, it is deeply intertwined with national security and foreign policy. Also, let me confess that this issue has dwelled and is deeply entrenched in my mind over the last 15 years. On several occasions, I thought of sharing it with my readers. At times, I did discuss this with my friends, intellectuals, religious scholars, and strategic experts in random and casual conversations; however, this is the first time I am presenting this thought in a structured manner for the readers.Why India Needs a New CapitalThis question may sound either extremely disturbing, revolutionary, or even lunatic to many readers. Such reactions are normal. However, I will try to answer these questions in this piece. My theoretical explanation discussing and analysing the whys and hows of my revolutionary or lunatic proposal ventures into history, strategy, sociology, astrology, and spirituality.Never a Capital of Any Powerful Indian KingTo begin with, arguments drawn from history can help build a robust case for proposing the idea of a new capital. Delhi was never the capital city of any of the powerful and legendary Indian empires and kings in both written and recorded history, and the unwritten and believed history. Lord Rama's capital was in Ayodhya and Lord Krishna's seat of power was in Dwarka (Gujarat). Interestingly, he was the most powerful king of his age, and he abandoned Mathura, a city that is closer to Delhi and was vulnerable to frequent attacks by his adversary, the demon king Jarasandh. Also, Mathura as a Yaduvanshi capital witnessed the rise of deceitful imposters like Kansa who made the Yadava capital city a hotbed of political intrigues and conspiracies.Later, in the Harappan civilisation, flourishing urban centres thrived in Gujarat (Dholavira) and Sindh (Mohenjo Daro) and a few in North India, such as Rakhigarhi. Delhi does not find a mention. Among the 16 Mahajanpadas, the Magadha region in today's Bihar became the most powerful kingdom. The first Indian empire of Nandas was in Magadha, followed by those of the Mauryas. Notably, Alexander had a tough time dealing with the hill tribal kingdoms of the Punjab-Afghanistan region. His victories are a matter of academic debate; however, after his much-touted victories against the Indian king Porus, his army was worn out, fatigued and exhausted. He had no energy left to chase the mighty Indian king with 60,000 elephants, sitting 3000 kms away in a strategically built capital city of Patliputra, surrounded by rivers on three sides. Imagine, if Delhi had been India's capital, Alexander would have been much emboldened after his initial minor successes and moved ahead to attack the capital city.Likewise, other great Indian kingdoms like Guptas, Satvahanas, Cholas, Gujar-Pratiharas etc. never had a capital in Delhi. Guptas, known for their golden era, ruled from Prayagraj, Satvahanas from Pratishthana (today's Aurangabad region), Cholas from Uraiyur (modern Tiruchirappalli) and Chalukyas from Aihole (Karnataka) and Badami. King Harshvardhana, after whom India's glorious ancient era started declining, also ruled from Kannauj. Notably, with time, India's seat of power in North India moved from Patliputra and Prayagraj to Kannauj under Harvardhana and finally to Delhi under Prithviraj Chauhan, the last Hindu ruler of Delhi. As we all know, after his defeat began an era of Islamic conquest, temple destructions and forced conversions, and the decline of Hindu glory, culture, and socio-religious institutions. The legendary king of Indian stories like Betal Pachisi and Singhasan Battisi, and many folklores, Raja Vikramaditya ruled from Ujjaini. Later, another glorious king Bhoj Parmar also ruled from Ujjaini.Ancient-era Indians had a highly developed sense of sub-continental geography. The ancient literature has umpteen references to various cities like Varanasi, Paithan, Patliputra, Badami, Kaling etc. Ancient religious texts like Mahabharata and Ramayana have detailed descriptions of 16 Mahajanpadas, their capitals and the other centres of economic, religious, and cultural importance. Even foreign territories like Bahlika (North-western regions), Sri Lanka, Java Sumatra and Siam have been discussed. The 12 Jyotirlingas and 52 Shaktipeethas also demonstrate a highly refined understanding of the geography of ancient Indians. Given that, the very fact that Delhi does not find a serious mention as a city of strategic, economic, or religious importance, certainly raises a question - why it was considered suitable to be a capital city?From a strategic point of view, it can be argued that Delhi could never be a great choice for the capital city because India faced major invasions from the Northwest. After crossing the Hindukush mountains, the invaders could easily reach the outskirts of Delhi within a month or two. The battles fought in Panipat by Prithviraj Chauhan, Ibrahim Lodhi and Marathas always gave a psychological edge to the enemy. The very fact that the main capital city was just a step away from the Panipat might have boosted the confidence of the enemy. At the same time, it would have put great mental pressure on the defending side as they were likely to perceive the Panipat battle as the last and the only chance to ward off the enemy which they could not afford to lose at any cost. Also, the capital city closer to the frontier areas was likely to make the border kings and subjects complacent that they would be saved by the king and his huge army, located a few hundred miles away. On the other hand, having a capital city in a place like Patliputra, Ujjaini and Prayagraj imparted a sense of urgency in building robust self-defence mechanism against the invaders as the royal armies might take time to traverse the huge distance and come to their rescue. Also, capital city far away from the borders dampened the hopes of the foreign invaders. Facing stiff resistance on the borders, the foreign invaders felt demoralised and often found themselves reluctant to move forward.Moreover, if they faced a strong centralised empire like the Mauryas, Nandas and Guptas, the mere thought of a mighty royal army sitting thousands of miles away scared them. Further, the ordeal of crossing those thousands of miles full of dense forests, wild animals, heat, hostile terrain, climate and the war-like hostile population motivated many legendary empire builders to find their way back home.History of Bloodshed, Chaos, and DisorderIn the history of Bharatvarsha/Aryavarta, the Delhi region is associated with bloodshed, internal feuds, chaos, and a decline of values. Towards the end of Dwapar Yuga, a major battle — Mahabharata — was fought in Kurukshetra, a battleground near the Delhi region, in today's Haryana. The battle was fought between the brothers Pandavas, the rulers of Indraprastha and Kauravas, the rulers of Hastinapur, both in the modern Delhi region. In Indian mythology and the discourse prevailing in the Sanatana spiritual and religious quarters, the Mahabharata battle is considered the most destructive battle of mankind's history. It is believed that in that battle, brahmastra, a mythical weapon of mass destruction, was used. With the Mahabharata war, Kshatriyas are said to have vanished, Kali Yuga started, and the decline of mighty Sanatana Dharma and civilisation began. Acharya Osho Rajneesh, one of the most learned Indian spiritual masters, in one of his discourses said that after Mahabharata, India has declined in every respect i.e., economy, culture, war and strategy, and this downward spiral has been continuous.Coming to recorded history, when Prithviraj Chauhan shifted his capital to Delhi, while presiding over as its ruler, he was defeated by Afghan invader Muhammad Ghori (1192-93). The Mamluk dynasty kings during the Sultanate period (1193- 1527) had their capital in Delhi. However, they could never have a stable reign of peace and prosperity. Raziya Sultana, the successor of Aibak and Iltutmish, was killed. Her successor was ousted by Balban, one of the main 40 Shamsi slaves (slaves of Balban). Balban's successors were killed and ousted by the Khaljis, who, in turn, were replaced by Tughlaqs. Finally, the Afghan Lodhis occupied the Delhi throne, and they were routed and ousted by Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in India. Notably, during the Sultanate rule, there was hardly a period of relative stability, peace, and prosperity. There were foreign invasions by Mongols, bloody internal intrigues, palace coups and murders, staunch resistance by the Hindu kings in the hinterland, farmers' revolts in North India and massive revolts by the local rulers in Bengal. The central authority remained perpetually weak during the Sultanate period and over time, an array of regional kingdoms emerged powerful such as Mewar, Marwar, Malwa, Gujarat, Vijaynagar, Pandyas, Kakatiyas, Jaunpur etc.Coming to the Mughals, it can be argued that they enjoyed a relative period of peace and stability until the time Agra was their capital city. However, after Shahjahan shifted the capital to Delhi in 1638, the Mughal decline started. For about seven years, Shahjahan remained a prisoner of the usurper king Aurangzeb and died a miserable and lonely death in the Agra fort. With Aurangzeb's rise and his execution of Dara Shikoh, the liberal prince and the rightful heir, the semblance of tolerance for non-Muslims practised by some of the early Mughal rulers came to a tragic end, following which began an era of an extremely fanatic and bigoted state policy centred on hatred and animosity towards Hindus and Sikhs. As evident from history, Aurangzeb's reign was marked by massive religious persecution of Hindus, Sikhs, and Christians (in a few cases). Temple demolition and forced conversions became the order of the day.Economically, the empire was drained by the Mansabdars and their corrupt land revenue-cum-taxation practices. Long-drawn and unsustainable wars, mainly with Marathas, Sikhs and to some extent with Rajputs, also drained the Mughal empire of its resources. After Aurangzeb's death, within 50 years, the Mughal empire was confined to the outskirts of Delhi. In the span of less than 50 years, there were six to seven incompetent kings ruling as puppets of the ambitious nobles. These ambitious nobles staged palace coups, killed the kings, and enthroned the new puppets. The puppet kings like Mohammad Shah Rangeela, had no charisma, strength and capability. They merely indulged in womanising and drinking. Ruled by such nincompoops, Delhi was open to plundering, murder and loot by foreign invaders like Nadir Shah, who is said to have killed 70,000 people in Delhi in three days (1739). Once again, the central authority collapsed and a range of local strongholds emerged such as Nawabs of Awadh, Marathas of Poona, Nizams of Hyderabad, Hyder Ali/Tipu Sultan of Mysore, and the East India Company, emerging as the most powerful player.Coming to the British, it can be observed that their kingdom and clout was intact and expanding, not only in India, but globally, until they ruled from Calcutta. They could even survive the bloody revolt of 1957. However, the British decline started after they shifted the capital from Calcutta to Delhi in 1912. In December 1911, the British emperor announced the shifting of the capital to Delhi. In 1912, during the capital shifting ceremony, Indian revolutionaries — Ras Bihari Bose and Madan Lal Dhingra — threw a bomb to kill the Viceroy, Lord Hardinge. He survived; however, his wife succumbed to the injuries. After 1912, the world order began to change with the onset of the decline of Pax-Britannica. By the beginning of the first world war, Germany and Japan had emerged as serious contenders. After the end of the first world war, the US and USSR had largely replaced the British as the superpowers.In India, the British faced serious challenges and disruptions from armed revolutionaries, mass movements like the Non-Cooperation (1919), Civil Disobedience (1930), Quit India movement (1942) and armed forces rebellions like the naval mutiny and Netaji-led INA attack. Economically also, the British were finding it hard to wield the Indian empire, the jewel in the British crown. After World War II, the British Empire was liquidated within a span of 20 years.Image and Memories in collective psychologyHaving discussed the history of Delhi, I would like to reiterate that in the civilisational sub-conscious plane of all those Indians who nurture moorings in history and Sanatana spiritual essence, Delhi holds a certain image. Built and destroyed several times, this city revives unpleasant memories of historical blunders and moments that had the potential to alter India's historical trajectory. Since the Mahabharata times, Delhi's image is associated with internal feuds, deceit, palace intrigues, manipulation, chaos, conflict, and instability. It is seen as the facilitator of centrifugal tendencies, detrimental to a strong central empire.Secondly, it was mostly ruled by foreign invaders, Islamic and the British; hence indigenous Indians anchored in Sanatana identity perceive it as a symbol of slavery, antithetical to Sanatana ethos and institutions. In the Islamic period i.e., during the Sultanate and Mughal rule, those individuals and institutions flourished which laid the foundation of modern-day Islamic radicalisation, polarisation, and Jihadist terrorism in South Asia. During Islamic rule, radical clerics like Sheikh Ahmed Sarhindi and Shah Waliullah advocated hatred against Hindus, Jizya, forced conversions and temple demolitions. Firuz Tughlaq, who burnt a Brahmin alive, and Mohammad Bin Tughlaq, under whose reign thousands of farmers were killed, ruled from Delhi. Aurangzeb, the last mighty Mughal emperor, and a poster boy of Islamic fanaticism, who executed Sikh gurus, destroyed temples like Kashi Vishwanath and converted people, ruled from Delhi. The Islamic radicalisation led to India's partition and bloody communal riots. Today's gravest internal security threat i.e., Islamic radicalisation and terrorism is perceived as a direct or indirect outcome of the events, institutions, ethos, and individuals that defined and shaped Islamic rule.Under British rule, the Sanatana civilisation underwent further decline, deterioration, and marginalisation. In both these periods, there were massive revolts against the imperial authority of Delhi by religious groups, local kings, chieftains, monks, and landlords. In fact, the phrase 'Dilli Durbar' became a symbol of imperial authority and oppression. After independence, India continued Delhi as the national capital. Along with that, we retained and strengthened the colonial values and essence in all the state institutions that we inherited from the British such as the judiciary, civil service, armed forces, academia, constitution, and our parliamentary democracy. Therefore, even today, Delhi does not evoke those sentiments, religious and cultural bonding, and spiritual moorings which a place like Banaras or Ujjain evokes. Delhi still appears like a remnant or a vestige of foreign powers and the politico-social culture they built.Before I make this point, it is pertinent to narrate what an Aghori mystic from Rajasthan — Mangla Maharaj — once told me. Answering my questions pertaining to India's much-touted ancient glory, subsequent decline, Islamic conversions, terrorism, anglicised and opportunistic Bhurasahab-like colonial bureaucracy, and the breed of leftist and liberal intellectuals, academics and journalists reviled for their alleged hatred for Santana traditions, he said with a mystic smile, 'as long as you have Delhi as your capital, you will continue to witness the culture of dishonesty, scrupulousness, manipulation, hypocrisy, nepotism and inherent hatred for Sanatana values and institutions.' His statement led me into a long discussion with him but I do not intend to digress and elaborate upon that here.However, the fact remains that Delhi was conquered, tortured, and plundered several times by foreign invaders. Having witnessed the horrors of massacres, rapes, and cultural genocide at the hands of the rapacious invading armies, the local population developed a strong sense of survival instincts. When survival instincts inform one's behaviour, thoughts, attitudes and actions, there is a strong likelihood of the erosion of values, morals, and ethics. It is like an 'apatdharma' i.e., actions deemed fit to protect oneself in adverse circumstances. In such a situation, the relationship between the rulers (foreign invaders) and their terrified subjects was not based on openness, transparency, accountability, trust and genuine love and loyalty towards the state or the kings. The subjects became experts in manipulation by lying, bribery, sycophancy, and opportunism. Over time, such ethos was likely to become mainstream and we inherited them post-1947. With such ethos dominant in society, the development of an establishment or to put it better, an ecosystem, constituted by a class of selfish politicians, opportunistic bureaucracy, intellectually dishonest and deracinated breed of academics-journos-intellectuals and an elitist judiciary, was the most natural outcome. Also, by default, such an establishment was bound to be a poor replica of their erstwhile foreign masters and loathful towards Sanatana values.Lastly, in all my interactions with the spiritual leaders, masters, religious monks and organisations of Sanatana and the affiliated schools such as Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism, I have found that they do not relate comfortably with Delhi. They are reminded of the execution of Guru Teg Bahadur, Banda Bairagi and their religious compatriots, temple destructions and forced conversions, and dejection and humiliation in several other ways. They do not find the essence of Dharma and ethics in Delhi's socio-cultural and political culture shaped by the rule and legacies of the foreign invaders. Even after independence, Hindu monks protesting cow slaughter were killed and most recently, Baba Ramdev, a spiritual guru, was humiliated and his followers mercilessly beaten while protesting corruption. The reason I have brought up this point is that whether we like it or not, agree or not, the spiritual forces including the organisations and individuals have played the most crucial role in bringing revolutionary changes in society, be it the Bhakti movement, 1857 revolt, social and religious reforms, peasant revolts, freedom struggle, formation of the Congress, science and technology, education and the rise of Marathas, Vijayanagara empire, Mewar etc. A place that does not sit well with India's essence i.e. its spiritual forces and mystics, may not be a great choice for the capital.To conclude, I would like to raise a question —Today, when India is inaugurating a new Parliament House, shouldn't we be pondering over a more fundamental question of changing India's capital and finding a centrally located place with robust roots in India's Sanatana civilisational legacy and values, and devoid of bitter colonial hangovers? Also, a place like that will not be alien to Southern and Eastern India, which often gets coverage for anti-Hindi and anti-North views.The author is a Cornell University graduate in public affairs, and bachelors from St Stephen's College, Delhi, is a policy analyst specialising in counterterrorism, Indian foreign policy and Afghanistan-Pakistan geopolitics.

"After the EU passed the law to make USB Type C the standard charging port for mobile devices, other countries are planning a similar move. The US has already floated the idea for manufacturers in the region, and this week, we have another contender looking for a common standard for charging. Brazil is the new country which wants to make USB Type C the default charging standard for mobile devices sold in the region. The suggestion has been made by the Wireless regulator of Brazil, which is now asking the people in the country whether they would like a similar ruling in the region.

"If you think this is a simple Wi-Fi router with a simple name, you would be completely off the mark. Not that it is your fault, because this piece of networking equipment looks quite conventional and humble. But the Linksys MR8300 router, AC2200 to be precise, may look like your typical, admittedly premium router, but can do a lot more. For starters, let us look at the price tag. You can get one of these from Linksys for around Rs 15,999 and that is a great start if online gaming and heavy bandwidth usage is what you need this for. But if range is a concern for you, in case you have a large home or perhaps the layout is irritating enough to restrict Wi-Fi signals in one part of the home, the Linksys MR8300 can transform into a mesh for you. Told ya, don't go by the conventional looks on this one! The party piece of the Linksys MR8300 is the ability to be a mesh. Yes, this router can be part of a Wi-Fi mesh system if that is what you need to get coverage through the entirety of your home. This integrates Linksys Velop technology, the same piece of smartness that the Velop dual-band and the Velop tri-band Wi-Fi mesh systems use. For this, the MR8300 can work with any Velop node, and doesn't discriminate between the dual-band or tri-band. The only condition is, the MR8300 has to be the primary node, connected with your modem (if that's a ADSL or VDSL connection) or the internet line, and the rest can then work around it. The Linksys MR8300 is a tri-band router, which means it has one 2.4GHz band up to a maximum of 400Mbps and two 5GHz bands which can do up to 867Mbps each. The Velop mesh systems also have the same stats for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Under the hood is a quad core processor chugging away at 716Mhz, with 512MB of RAM. The setup is done via the Linksys app (free for Android and iOS) or the Linksys Smart Wi-Fi web console, and this is the one-stop solution for most Linksys routers including this one, as well as the Velop mesh systems. The Linksys app is one of the neatest when it comes to intuitiveness, easy of setup and management as well as configuring a fairly detailed set of options. The proverbial cherry on the cake has to be the ability to separate the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. It takes next to no time to plug in the router, fire up the app and have this up and running in no time. The app will guide you through the simple process of adding the mesh nodes. In terms of the design, the MR8300 looks very similar to the Linksys EA8300 from the not too recent past. The combination of the matte black panels and the glossy heart looks good. You really wouldn't mind keeping this in a central position in your home, something that is rare for a standard looking router. When placed on a flat surface, such as an end table, you'll notice that the front of the router sits lower while the back is much higher, also because all the ports reside there. That means the status light in the middle is easy to see. There are 4 gigabit LAN ports as well as a USB 3.0 port. In a nutshell, this looks like pretty much most routers you would have seen over the years. And largely works the same way too. That is till you unlock the real surprise performance element, which is the mesh. Wireless performance is its strongest point. By default, the router chooses the best band, which in most likelihood will be the 5GHz band. You can set device priorities in case you want to give the bandwidth preference to any particular PC or laptop—this comes in handy when there are multiple devices vying for bandwidth on the same network. And that is quite common too though we don't realize it, in the era of 4K streaming and online gaming. The range and the internet speeds that the MR8300 exhibited on its own during the testing was at par with the similarly priced Netgear Nighthawk X6. At that stage, add a node and then another node, and the range simply expands in the blink of an eye, with a negligible drop in internet speeds and bandwidth. Gamers would probably appreciate the efforts put in by Linksys to reduce the ping times, which they say are as much as 93 percent lesser than rival routers. That being said, unless you are gaming, you'll not notice much difference with 4K video streaming, which is already buttery smooth. Why would you need the Linksys MR8300? The idea is to have a powerful router at the core and then build a mesh around it. With a price tag of around Rs 15,000 for the MR8300, you really are embarking on a rather pricey journey in a way. But what can you do, if your large home or your fast internet line demand it? What this entails is buying individual nodes, and that number depends on how large a space you need to cover. Adding one node to the Linksys MR8300 would make the range as wide as 4500 square feet, which is more than enough for most modern-day apartments. But for this, you will spend around Rs 19,000 for each Velop tri-band node. The Velop dual-band node costs lesser at around Rs 6,500 per node, but you will be creating a bandwidth bottleneck instead and that'll cause its own set of problems later. The versatility is great, and there are no deal-breakers in terms of the performance, the ability to set this up and the ease of using it. However, the net spend that you are looking at probably isn't everyone's cup of tea. But if your large home deserves it, there is no point resisting. Your choice really rests between the Velop Tri-band mesh or buy this and add nodes one by one.","You may not immediately realize it, but the Linksys MR8300 can be a part of a mesh. As long as it is the base unit.",
"Internet is really the next big source of entertainment and as we see it, DTH and cable network providers are in jeopardy. Consumers have partially, or in some cases completely moved to online streaming services to watch content at their convenience. Video-on-demand services (VOD) like Netflix, Hotstar, Prime Video and even YouTube, have not only taken over mobiles, tablets and PCs, but TVs as well. In fact, a number of indigenous players have also started offering their own streaming platform offering a wide range of regional content as well. Now the best way to enjoy them is on a large screen at the convenience of your home, preferably on a smart TV. But what if you already have a serious high-quality TV but no access to apps? Well, until now, the best option that anyone would recommend was getting an Amazon Fire TV Stick. You get access to most of the popular streaming apps and services and the interface makes it easy to use. Plus it isn't very expensive. However, there is just one problem. There is no app store available on the device so you can't go beyond the pre-installed apps. The next best option is to get the Apple TV, which works really great and with the upcoming Apple TV+ service, it should be a solid option in our opinion. Then there Android TV boxes which are offered by a number of brands, with the most popular ones being the Nvidia Shield TV and Xiaomi's Mi Box. One of the newest offerings is by ACT Fibernet. The third-largest wired broadband service provider in India announced the ACT Stream TV 4K back in April stepping into the content delivery segment with its own Android TV box. Now, this is one of the most unique offerings in the country as it comes with the latest Android TV software based on 9.0 Pie so you get access to all the apps offered on the platform. With that, the box also offers live television channels and will continue to add more in due time. This essentially means that the company is aiming to completely take over your television needs. Now the device itself is pretty simple. It's a small box offering two USB ports, an HDMI port, an AV output, and even an SD card slot to expand the storage. The device runs on a HiSilicon 3798M V200 chipset with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. There is built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth while the USB ports allow connectivity to a hard disk, USB drives, joysticks, and cameras. Along with that, you get HDR as well as Dolby Audio support. The box is easy to hook up to your TV and once you go through the setup process, you will be presented with a slightly tweaked version of Android TV. The company has added some additions to the user interface like adding sections on the top for your home screen, apps and games, live tv and special offers. There is a carousel underneath scrolling through different movies and shows that you might be interested in. Then you have all your apps and the company has partnered with all the big names including Netflix, Hotstar, Sony Liv, Hooq, Zee5, YouTube, Sun NxT and more. The box also offers over 100 Free to air TV channels which are soon to expand to paid channels in the future. The bundled remote comes with dedicated Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Store and Live TV 'hot buttons' for quick access. And since it is an Android TV, you get access to the Google Assistant as well as thousands of apps from the Play Store. The interface works seamlessly and for a limited period, the company is offering one month Zee5 and two months HOOQ subscription and access to premium Live TV channels on a complimentary basis until 31st of December 2019. The box is quite versatile as you can easily connect to a controller to play games as well. I hooked up a Logitech F310 gamepad using the USB port on the box and was able to play Asphalt 8 and Real Racing 3 with ease. The box supports most of the popular controllers including the Xbox and PlayStation controllers. You can also plug in a hard drive or a thumb drive to play media on your TV through the box. ACT is also offering a unique proposition called the single click subscription. Customers can subscribe to the various streaming partners and channels that have tied up with the company and pay for their subscription directly as part of their monthly broadband bill. The ACT Stream TV 4K box can be purchased for Rs 4,499, and as a special launch offer the device will be available at a refundable deposit of Rs 1,500 on select plans. The ACT Stream TV 4K box is available for existing customers and new customers on select plans. You can check them out on ACT's official website. After using the device for a good month, I felt that it is pretty much flawless. You get all of your popular video streaming apps including regional ones as well as some live TV channels, which are expected to expand in the future. Then you have the ability to extend the usability by either playing local media off external storage and even do gaming to some extent. The UI is stable and responsive and considering it is running on the latest version, you get peace of mind as well. The biggest and probably the only reason why one might not go for this box is the broadband bundling. If you don't have an ACT broadband connection, then you can't use get your hands on this streaming box. The company has configured the box in a way that you can only operate it once and only if it is connected to an ACT connection. While the company has extensive coverage, the service is yet to be made available in my area.","If you are looking for an Android TV box, this is probably the best choice, provided you have the company's broadband service.",

"From phasing out combustible engines to rolling out new and advanced electric vehicles, automakers around the world are taking significant steps to go green. While electric cars have been gradually gaining popularity, they still have certain limitations such as range and battery charging time that deter customers from making a switch from conventional vehicles to electric ones.Amid the rush to drum up new methods and make electric vehicles widely acceptable, a Switzerland-based startup named Morand has developed a new battery technology that can charge electric vehicles batteries at lightning speed.Also Read: Indian Electric Vehicle Manufacturers Need to Move to LFP Batteries, Says Oben Electric CEOThe company claims that its Morand eTechnology can recharge electric vehicles in just 72 seconds. According to its description, eTechnology is an ultra-fast rechargeable battery pack that uses innovative hybrid ultracapacitors (HUC) cells along with advanced controllers to recharge and discharge quickly.Electric cars usually take anywhere between 30 minutes and a couple of hours to fully charge while a conventional car that runs on petrol or diesel takes just few minutes to fuel up. But with eTechnology, the charging time can be reduced drastically, which can prove to be a game-changer in the EV market.Besides automotive, the technology can be used in robotics, e-mobility, drones, locomotives, and defence among others.Morand says that its unique battery pack is more reliable than other electric vehicle storage systems and can be effective in applications that require fast 5-minute charges. Morand also claims to have developed a solution to protect electric vehicles battery pack from fire.In addition, the cells in the battery, according to Morand, also have longer lifespan. While conventionally used lithium-ion batteries last for 3,000 to 5,000 cycles, eTechnology can complete over 50,000 cycles at C-rating of 50.The company has also tested its eTechnology and demonstrated its capability to charge and discharge at astonishing speed. The battery pack could reacharge in less than 2 minutes (3 modules of 400V and 2.4 kWh each) at up to 900A/360W.SourceRead all the Latest Auto News here",A Switzerland-based startup named Morand claims that it has developed a new battery technology that can charge electric vehicles batteries at lightning speed,"Amid the rush to drum up new methods and make electric vehicles widely acceptable, a Switzerland-based startup named Morand has developed a new battery technology that can charge electric vehicles batteries at lightning speed."

"The Amazon Fire TV Stick family of media players are perhaps the slickest way of upgrading your smart TV experience with access to video streaming platforms including Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar, Voot, Zee5, Sony Liv, Lionsgate Play, Discovery+ and more. However, there was one really annoying thing, and that is when you set up the Fire TV Stick for the first time, you had to manually enter your Amazon credentials, that is your ID and password, using the remote and the on-screen keyboard. Chances are, your Amazon ID would be your email ID, which would be quite long as it is. Now, Amazon says you can use an authentication code instead to set this up.The way this works is that the Code-Based Linking allows Fire TV Stick users can sign in without the need of entering Amazon credentials with the on-screen keyboard using the Fire TV remote. On the setup page, you will see a URL that could be opened on the web browser on a smartphone or tablet. You will also see a code on the TV, alongside the URL. Once you have opened the URL on your phone and signed in with your Amazon ID there, you can simply enter the code and sign in seamlessly on the Fire TV Stick. From this point onwards, you can set up the Fire TV Stick and also sign in to streaming apps either with the on-screen keyboard and remote method or if the app supports it, similar code-based login method.At this time, Amazon sells three Fire TV Stick variants in India. There is the 2020 edition of the Fire TV Stick that is priced at Rs 3,999 alongside the Fire TV Stick Lite that is priced at Rs 2,999 and the flagship Fire TV Stick 4K which is priced at Rs 5,999.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here","The way this works is that the Code-Based Linking allows Fire TV Stick users can sign in without the need of entering Amazon credentials with the on-screen keyboard using the Fire TV remote.

"Opera is set to enter the AI chatbot arena by using the popular ChatGPT in its products. The integration will happen later this year and the company has not exactly talked about the details of its plans for the AI chatbot. The fact that Opera wants to use the capability of ChatGPT hardly comes as a surprise. That's because of the vote of confidence that Microsoft has given Open AI by investing billions and integrating ChatGPT into Bing and Microsoft Edge browser recently. Opera's parent company Kunlun Tech confirmed this plan, saying that all of its products will be integrating with ChatGPT, which is likely to include Opera as well. Opera has a variety of web browsers in the market, and like Microsoft Edge, we expect ChatGPT to make its mark on the Opera browser and probably few other products that the company offers. To be fair, Opera is not among the top choice of web browsers these days, with a miniscule share among the peers. Google leads the segment with Chrome but when you talk about Opera, the browser is even behind the likes of Mozilla Firefox and Samsung's Internet browser. We've already seen what integrating ChatGPT could do for a product like Bing that has been around for years but couldn't compete with the likes of Google in the search arena. Now, with ChatGPT under its wing, Bing has run into a waitlist of people eager to try out the new experience offered by the search engine. Opera does have other non-browser products as well but we're not sure how ChatGPT could enhance its profile, performance and image in any way. Apple is still the big absence from all the recent AI talk. The company has reportedly held a secretive meeting with its employees to gauge its readiness in the AI segment but we'll probably have to wait till the WWDC 2023 later this year to know more about the company's plans.Read all the Latest Tech News here",The parent company of Opera has made the big reveal this week but has not given more details about the integration.,"Opera has a variety of web browsers in the market, and like Microsoft Edge, we expect ChatGPT to make its mark on the Opera browser and probably few other products that the company offers."
"Prompted by the growing number of job offers and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across sectors, IITs are revising undergraduate curriculum to launch full-time degree courses in the discipline along with data science and other emerging technologies.Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Gandhinagar, one of the new-age IITs, is the latest to launch a BTech in AI from the new academic session 2023-24. While IIT-Patna launched a full-time degree course in AI and data science this January, IIT-Guwahati launched a BTech in Data Science and AI (DSAI). IIT-Hyderabad was the first tech institute across the country and among very few globally to have launched a BTech in AI in 2019.While many IITs such as Madras, Delhi and Bombay do offer offline courses for working professionals in AI and data analytics as well as dual degree courses (five-years programme) for on-campus students in which they get to study subjects such as robotics and machine learning, among others in the post-graduate year, those offering full-time undergraduate courses in the discipline are still a handful.On the expanding focus on AI, Prof Rajat Moona, director, IIT-Gandhinagar, said the undergraduate curriculum was revised this year to adapt to rapidly evolving technology. This has also helped add more seats to the undergraduate programmes at the institute.'With the introduction of BTech in AI, we will enable students to build systems that harness data collection and computation to solve important global challenges. Apart from statistical and computational techniques, this program emphasises responsible use of AI and developing interdisciplinary domain knowledge,' said Moona.Also, the institute recently inaugurated a laboratory for AI and data science to foster a collaborative ecosystem in the fields of data sciences, machine learning, artificial intelligence and applied mathematics.Even as computer science engineering, which entails AI and ML as sub-branches, is a full-fledged and the most-sought-after discipline at IITs across India, one wonders what AI as a discipline in itself will offer.'The roots of AI go down deep and are interlinked with all other branches of engineering and sciences, including computer science, maths, physics, civil, mechanical and so on. We need people who know how to develop techniques in AI to take it to the next level. The full-fledged degree course will have students dive deep into the fundamentals of AI and how to improve on it,' said Prof Anirban Dasgupta, who teaches computer science at IIT-Gandhinagar.AI has become like a writing code, he said, adding that it's going to be needed by all kinds of engineers. For example, civil engineers need AI to know the resilience, the same way it's applicable to climate and weather prediction technology, same way beyond physics in a gravitational wave detector (device to detect cosmic gravitational waves), it's all about data analytics that help catch the signal and determine if two blackholes are colliding.'Based on what we see around, there is a huge interest in AI, which is not just restricted to computer science graduates. Plus, there is a demand for AI-qualified graduates in the market and the degree courses shall fill that gap in. AI will become one of the pillars of any branch of engineering in the near future,' said Dasgupta.The placements season across IITs, which has just ended, saw a significant chunk of high paying as well as the highest number of job offers from top companies being made to computer science graduates and those having studied AI, robotics, data science and other emerging technologies at the post-graduate level.According to faculty members at IIT-Guwahati, the AI programmes provide a comprehensive range of courses to cater to both basic and advanced levels of learning. The basic courses, such as Introduction to Data Science, Introduction to Optimization, and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, offer students a solid foundation in these domains.'On the other hand, the advanced courses, such as Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning, and Data Mining, delve deeper into AI and applications, equipping students with advanced skills. The programmes also offer elective courses on interdisciplinary subjects, allowing students to explore and specialise in specific areas of interest,' said Prof Debanga Raj Neog, assistant professor, Mehta Family School of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, IIT-Guwahati.Currently, counselling sessions for admission to IITs are going on for those having cleared JEE (Advanced). The new academic session will commence from July-August.Meanwhile, IIT-Jodhpur too has invited applications for part-time MTech in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) for working professionals, starting this session.","The placements season across IITs, which has just ended, saw a significant chunk of high paying as well as the highest number of job offers from top companies being made to computer science graduates and those having studied AI, robotics, data science and other emerging technologies at the post-graduate level",
"A home broadband line is certainly categorized as a necessity now, in the era of work from home. No longer can you brush aside a wired broadband line for home as an avoidable additional expense. To get work done remotely, for your child's online classes and for OTT streaming once you desperately need to unwind after work, the reality is that our 3G and 4G mobile networks may just not be geared up for the tasks at hand. Also because of the unique situation where a large demographic is working from home, there is more load on the mobile networks in residential areas. Yet, a home broadband line is still something a lot of people cannot spend a lot on or choose not to spend a lot on. And that often inevitably leads to the question—what is the cheapest broadband connection that I can buy for home? All popular broadband service providers, or internet service providers, have really interesting entry spec plans that don't really hurt the wallet. Reliance JioFiber, Airtel Xstream broadband, ACT broadband, BSNL, Tata Sky Broadband, Excitel and others all have plans that work out around the Rs 500 price point, give or take a bit, with speeds ranging between 30Mbps to 50Mbps, depending on provider plans. And in the case of Excitel, 100Mbps speeds in case you go for the long-term recharge.Reliance JioFiber: The JioFiber Rs 399 broadband plan offers you symmetric upload and download speeds of 30Mbps. You'll get a home phone as well which offers unlimited voice calls across India. The data usage bundled with this plan is unlimited. You can get this in the prepaid option as well as the postpaid billing plans if you pay in for the 6 months or 12 months options. Airtel Xstream: The Airtel Xstream Unlimited broadband plan priced at Rs 499 per month billing plan offers 40Mbps speeds. The data that is bundled is unlimited, which basically means 3333GB of fair usage policy (FUP) beyond which speeds will reduce but you won't be charged for any additional data use. The plan also gets unlimited voice calls, national and local, along with Airtel Thanks benefits that include the subscriptions for the Airtel Xstream OTT platform, Wynk Music as well as options from Shaw Academy.BSNL and MTNL: The state run BSNL is in no mood to let the private ISPs run away with the market share and attractive affordable broadband plans. In most circles, BSNL offers the Fibre Basic broadband plan which is priced at Rs 449 per month and offers 30Mbps speeds. It is slightly more expensive than the Reliance JioFiber broadband plan, in terms of pure monthly cost. You'll get an FUP of 3300GB per month and a landline phone which allows for unlimited local and national calls. Yet, MTNL which offers broadband services in Delhi and Mumbai, has listed the entry spec plan for its fiber broadband service as the FTH-777 plan which costs Rs 777 per month and gets you 100Mbps speeds with 800GB data per month at high speeds and the any usage beyond that at 1Mbps for the rest of the billing cycle.Tata Sky Broadband: The entry spec 50Mbps broadband plan is available if you choose to pay in advance for 3 months, 6 months or 12 months. While the other plans which offers 100Mbps speeds or more have the monthly billing option, this doesn't. Nevertheless, you'll pay Rs 1797 for 3 months, Rs 3300 for 6 months and Rs 6000 for 12 months. This works out to around Rs 599 per month, around Rs 550 per month and around Rs 500 per month respectively. Excitel: Excitel, a broadband service that is available in multiple cities in India including Delhi NCR, has the Fiber First 100Mbps unlimited data plan in the prepaid avatar. This means the more months you pay for in advance, the lesser the price you pay. For instance, it'll cost Rs 699 per month with the monthly billing but cost Rs 565 per month if you pay for three months in advance, Rs 508 per month if you pay for 4 months in advance and as low as Rs 399 per month if you pay for an entire year upfront. To be fair, Excitel is offering significantly faster 100Mbps speeds for around the same sort of monthly outlay, as a lot of the other ISPs charging for 40Mbps or 50Mbps. ACT Broadband: Last but not least is ACT Broadband, which has listed the ACT Swift broadband plan in certain cities. This gets you 50Mbps speeds with unlimited data that has an FUP of 3300GB data per month. Not the most affordable either, priced at Rs 710 per month. Mind you, while most users may never get close to the FUP limit particularly on 50Mbps broadband plans, ACT does penalize heavy users by reducing the speeds to 512kbps for the rest of the billing cycle. In certain other cities, there is the ACT Starter plan listed at Rs 549 per month that gets you 40Mbps speeds.Read all minute-by-minute news updates for Uttar Pradesh election results 2022, Punjab election results 2022, Uttarakhand election results 2022, Manipur election results 2022, and Goa election results 2022.Click here for seat-wise LIVE result updates.","Looking for a home broadband connection?

"NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal on Friday found himself the subject of a conundrum in the Bombay High Court when an older petition he filed against the Eknath Shinde-BJP government in Maharashtra came up for hearing before the Chief Justice's bench. Bhujbal followed NCP leader Ajit Pawar into the government last Sunday and is now a minister in the dispensation he sued.Addressing the elephant in the room, Bombay High Court Chief Justice Nitin Jamdar asked Bhujbal's lawyer to confer with his client on the fate of the petition, which accused the Eknath Shinde government of blocking developmental funds promised in the budget passed by the previous Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition.'Have your asked your client whether you want to proceed with or withdraw the petition,' asked Justice Jamdar. Bhujbal's lawyer Sambhaji Tope sought an adjournment and said the petition would be withdrawn since his client is now a minister in the government and 'he won't face the problem'.The petition had stemmed from senior NCP leader Bhujbal's allegation that funds for development work in his constituency Yevla in Nashik were not being disbursed since the Shiv Sena-BJP government came to power ousting the Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena-Congress-NCP following in June 2022. A few days after Shinde took oath, NCP leaders Ajit Pawar, Chhagan Bhujbal and Dilip Walse Patil met the Maharashtra CM, asking him to review his decision and disburse the funds for developmental works. But when funds were reportedly not released, several legislators from the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) approached the courts. 'On the basis of an earlier order in Rajesh Tope case, around 23 MLAs had filed a petition at Bombay and Aurangabad Bench of the High Court because funds were not being disbursed to them. These funds were allocated in the budget passed by the MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) government, but when the new government came to power, they stopped funds allocated as per the budget,' said Bhujbal's lawyer Tope.'We are waiting until July 17 when applications from Aurangabad will be transferred here, following which we might withdraw the plea because Bhujbal sahab is now a minister and he won't face the problem. The court has asked me to take instructions from my client, but because I couldn't reach out to him, I sought an adjournment,' added Tope.Bhujbal's case was the second instance this week of political developments leading to awkward moments in court. On Thursday, a division bench of Justices Nitin Sambre and RN Laddha heard a plea filed by Hasan Mushrif, now a minister in the Ajit Pawar faction, for quashing an FIR against him in Kolhapur on charges of cheating. The public prosecutor in the case, JP Yagnik, sought an adjournment to take new instructions, citing 'change in circumstances'.Amused, the court asked the lawyer in lighter vein whether he was appearing for the accused or the State.The NCP, founded by Sharad Pawar in 1999, witnessed a split on July 2 with Ajit Pawar, claiming support of over 40 MLAs and joining the Shiv Sena-BJP coalition government in Maharashtra. Nine NCP MLAs, including Bhujbal, were sworn-in as ministers in the Maharashtra government at a surprise cabinet expansion on Sunday.","The petition, which accused the Eknath Shinde government of blocking developmental funds, will most likely be withdrawn 'because Bhujbal sahab is now a minister and he won't face the problem', the NCP leader's lawyer said",

"In what could signal a thaw in the strained ties between the Congress high command and the now-sacked Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, the rebel leader reportedly met former party chief Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday ahead of the crucial assembly session on August 14. Top Congress sources said the meeting took place a little after noon at Rahul Gandhi's residence and a ""positive outcome"" was expected. Sources also confirmed that Pilot has been in touch with the top Congress leadership and a formula for his return was being worked out. Sources in Gandhi's office had earlier said Pilot, who last month engineered a rebellion with 18 Congress MLAs and ditched the Ashok Gehlot government, was in touch with senior leader KC Venugopal. The Pilot camp's rebellion seems to have divided the Congress after party MLAs in Rajasthan demanded action against the rebels led by him even though the Grand Old Party is making last-ditch efforts to placate Pilot and bring him back into the fold. At the Congress Legislature Party on Sunday, sources said state Congress in-charge Avinash Pandey has said that he will not advocate for rebels in front of party high command as the MLAs demanded action. The developments came even as sources within the party said efforts are still on to reach out to Pilot, who was reportedly miffed after the SOG sent him a notice to record his statement in a case of alleged poaching of Congress MLAs in the state. Sources said Congress Working Committee member Raghuvir Meena said the rebels would be forgiven if they voted for the party in the floor test. The Congress said it was in touch with some rebel MLAs and hoped for clarity by Monday night on Pilot's plans. A similar softening of stand was seen when Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, after publicly rebuking Pilot, said he would accept the rebels if they apologised to the 'high command'. Nineteen Congress rebels, including Pilot, revolted against Gehlot, posing a threat to the Congress government in Rajasthan. Congress removed Pilot as the Deputy Chief Minister and as the state chief of the party on July 14 but also sent many feelers to Pilot, though the rebel leader has not opened his cards yet even though he has said he would not join the BJP. Gehlot has convened a session of the state assembly on August 14 where he will prove his majority.","At the Congress Legislature Party on Sunday, sources said state Congress in-charge Avinash Pandey has said that he will not advocate for rebels in front of party high command as the MLAs demanded action.","Sources in Gandhi's office had earlier said Pilot, who last month engineered a rebellion with 18 Congress MLAs and ditched the Ashok Gehlot government, was in touch with senior leader KC Venugopal"
"MANCHESTER, England: Britain's Queen Elizabeth met some of the young victims of the Manchester bombing in hospital on Thursday as well as doctors, nurses and members of the emergency services who responded to the attack that killed 22 and injured more than 100. The queen spoke to patients at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, where 19 casualties are still being treated after what she called the ""wicked"" blast, five in critical care. Asked by the queen if she had come to Manchester especially for the Ariana Grande concert, 14-year-old Evie Mills, from Harrogate, said yes, it was a birthday present. ""She (Grande) sounds very, very good, a very good singer,"" the queen responded in footage broadcast by Sky News. ""It's dreadful. Very wicked ... to target that sort of thing."" Wearing an orange hat and bright blue jacket, the queen was met with cheers at the hospital and in comments to Mills and her parents, noted how ""everyone's united here"". Eight hospitals in and around the northern English city treated 116 casualties injured in the blast after the concert on Monday evening, NHS England said on Thursday, and 23 remain in critical care. ""She's lovely, it was just ... mindblowing really -- you just wouldn't really expect it,"" 15-year-old Millie Robson from County Durham told Sky News after meeting the queen.","Eight hospitals in and around the northern English city treated 116 casualties injured in the blast after the concert on Monday evening, NHS England said on Thursday, and 23 remain in critical care.","The queen spoke to patients at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, where 19 casualties are still being treated after what she called the ""wicked"" blast, five in critical care."
"Slowly and very surely has cricket started off on the road to resumption.Among the worst hit nations in this pandemic has been England with their domestic season as good as over. However, the ECB has also been one of the first boards to try and resume cricket, calling upon their bowlers to resume training. The ECB announced that up to 18 bowlers will be involved from Thursday across seven venues before batsmen and wicketkeepers become involved from June 1.The novel coronavirus brought the sporting world to a screeching halt, but May has brought about some positivity with sport returning under watchful eyes. Former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen believes that even though the players will want to play, resumption should only go ahead once everyone's safety is assured.'Cricket is a part of the world's entertainment package in so many countries just like football, rugby and tennis. So when it gets back it will get back okay and players will want to play but it's going to be different as players will be playing behind closed doors,' Pietersen said.'But it should only return when it's safe to do so, the players' safety, the administrators' safety, people at the ground; everyone must be safe and comfortable.' It's has been a roller-coaster ride for English cricket in the last twelve months with the World Cup triumph at Lord's followed by a keenly contested drawn Ashes, two Tests against New Zealand and then the tour of South Africa, the last being a landmark tour for captain Joe Root according to Pietersen. 'Root did not have the best Ashes but he had a wonderful tour of South Africa and he really got himself together. The team understood him and he made great changes. He was awesome.' Pietersen who was among those with reservations about the leadership, said. 'As a broadcaster I was incredibly proud as to how he led that tour after coming under lots of scrutiny at the start.'England won the South Africa Test series 3-1 and Root won over some of his critics.However, an injury to their 25-year-old fast bowling sensation Jofra Archer raised plenty of questions about the England management. Archer bowled 42 overs in the first innings of the first Test against the Proteas; more than Stuart Broad has ever bowled in a single Test innings.Pietersen, who made his Test debut in the famous Ashes series win of 2005, has voiced concerns about the England pace bowling battery which is led by the veteran duo of James Anderson and Stuart Broad and suggested making Archer the focal point.'Jofra Archer's schedule's going to have to be looked at and he is also going to have to be protected.''Archer needs to be spoken to in a manner of which what do you want to play and when do you want to play how do you want to play because you want him bowling 95 mph ever single session. You don't want bowl him 25 overs a day in a Test, maybe 15 overs odd and really get the best out of him.'In ODIs and T20Is he's a superstar so you don't need to worry about him.' While Pietersen hopes that England can take of Archer properly, he has been heavily invested in animal conservation and highlighting the plight of the rhinoceros. His charity, Save our Rhino Africa/India (SORAI), will be relaunched towards the end of June and he hopes to be able to help navigate through the human-wildlife conflict problem across the globe.'We need to respect and understand that climate change needs to be looked at and we need to look at endangered species and poaching needs to stop. We are getting too big as a population and eating into the wildlife space. So at SORAI we will be looking at such matters in the not too distant future,' Pietersen signed off.","Pietersen, who made his Test debut in the famous Ashes series win of 2005, has voiced concerns about the England pace bowling battery which is led by the veteran duo of James Anderson and Stuart Broad and suggested making Archer the focal point.",

"The Shiv Sena (UBT) on Thursday said that mere opposition to Sharia' cannot be the basis for the Uniform Civil Code, asserting that UCC also means having equality in law and justice for all. Sharia is an Islamic religious law based on the teachings of the Quran and the traditional sayings of Muhammad.In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana', the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should first respect uniform law by disqualifying 40 MLAs including Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, whose Urban Development department has taken action against 18 ex-corporators from the Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC). Earlier this week, 18 former Congress corporators of BNCMC were disqualified from contesting any elections for the next six years for voting against their party's official mayoral candidate in 2019 and defying party whip. Only opposing the Sharia law of Muslims is not the basis for Uniform Civil Code. Having equality in law and justice is also Uniform Civil Code, the editorial said. What law is it if 'corrupt people, ministers, businessmen of the ruling party' are protected and leaders from opposition parties are implicated under anti-corruption statutes, it asked. The Shiv Sena (UBT) also questioned the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) inquiry initiated by the Centre into alleged irregularities in the reconstruction expenses of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's official residence.In an apparent reference to CM Shinde, it said the landlords of Maharashtra have kept two-four official bungalows and resorted to unchecked splurging. There should also be uniform law in this case, it said. PM Modi on Tuesday pushed for implementation of a UCC in the country and said Muslims are being instigated over the sensitive issue.Even the Supreme Court has advocated for a UCC, but those practising vote bank politics are opposing it, said Modi and asked how the country can have two systems, touching upon an issue closely identified with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with less than a year left for the Lok Sabha polls.","In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana', the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should first respect uniform law by disqualifying 40 MLAs including Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde","In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana', the Shiv Sena said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should first respect uniform law by disqualifying 40 MLAs including Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, whose Urban Development department has taken action against 18 ex-corporators from the Bhiwandi City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC)."

"Everything's getting connected around us. Computers. Smart mobile computing devices. Embedded systems. Documents. People. Creatures. Pets. Even ideas. Everything now has the possibility of being a node on the network, able to publish and to subscribe. Everything. Before this decade is out, there's talk of 50 billion connected things. The Internet of Everything. At one time, this figure seemed fanciful. Now, if anything, it looks conservative. Of that 50 billion, human beings are going to be in a minority, even allowing for multiple devices per person. So it's not surprising that the age-old question of being 'controlled by technology' raises its head. Some human beings have this penchant for 'Exit, followed by a bugbear', I suppose. It may be what technology wants. But it's not going to happen. Not in 2014, not for a considerable time. Not until we find a way of taking a machine to court, using it, winning, and getting paid by the machine. There's the rub. We've had the internet. We've had the Internet of Things, we've had the Internet of Everything. As Marc Benioff memorably stated at salesforce.com's annual customer, partner and developer conference Dreamforce last November, we are now in the era of the Internet of Customers. Behind every device, there is a customer. Behind every tweet, there is a customer. Every like, every comment, every rating, every review, every purchase, every sale: There is always a customer. After all, people buy from people and sell to people. That's been the case since people learnt to trade with each other, and it's unlikely to change. In the main, we use technology to help us make decisions, and not to make the decisions per se. And if you don't make the decision and you can't be sued, then you're not in control. Most of the time, we don't actually let technology make decisions, but to present us with information upon which decisions can be taken. In so doing, we may ask of technology that our process of making decisions is simplified: Crunching numbers, presenting them in consumable, comprehensive ways, making them easy to find and use. Providing answers to questions that inform us, that provide us with more information. When I was at school in Calcutta, we had odd notions of what the developed world looked like. For example, we used to joke that a deprived foreign schoolboy was one who couldn't afford new batteries for his calculator. Fast forward to today, when some people think that happiness has two principal measures: A full signal and a full battery. In some way, we were being serious about calculators. I think I must have been part of the last generation at school to learn to use slide rules, something that faded out by the time I left school in 1975. But other mind-numbing jobs had not yet been outsourced to technology. We had physical paper-based tables for many things, particularly for trigonometry and for logarithms. I've watched my three children grow up over the years, and I've never seen any of them carrying around tables of logarithms. Outsourcing mundane jobs to technology (and not just information technology) makes sense. As Kevin Kelly pointed out, it helps us evolve. There is a school of thought that suggests man's sentience is directly related to our conquest of fire: That we put the 'technology' of fire to work for us, used it to break down and simplify our food intake, allowed us to build external stomachs as a result, and thereby make our physical stomachs smaller and our brains bigger over time. Labour-saving devices (I'm tempted to spell that 'labor' but I shall resist that temptation) make sense, and in no way have us ceding control. Sometimes we can have the illusion that technology is in control of something. Like when your bank manager says he can't give you the overdraft you want, because the system says no. All that means is that the discretionary power to make the decision has even been taken away from the person who says that to you; nothing more and nothing less. The decision in contexts such as these has been codified by someone, and then carried out by the 'system': It didn't take the decision, all it did was enforce a set of rules it was instructed to enforce. Decision-support systems by their very nature are not decision-making systems, so the question of being in control doesn't arise.","Everything's getting connected around us.

"Researchers from Uppsala University identified DNA regions connected with physical activity or leisure screen usage in a big worldwide investigation. The findings show the benefits of physical activity for health and imply that a more sedentary lifestyle might be explained by how muscles adapt to exercise.The findings of the study were published in the journal Nature Genetics.It is well established that a physically active lifestyle and less time spent sitting are associated with better health. However, trends over time suggest that people in higher income countries are becoming increasingly less active. It is also known from twin and family studies that genetic factors influence physical activity levels, but the biological basis for why some people are more physically active than others remains poorly understood.To improve our understanding of mechanisms that influence physical activity and its role in disease prevention, researchers from Uppsala University, together with researchers from around the world, combined genetic data from over 700,000 individuals participating in 51 research studies. In doing so, they identified 99 DNA regions that are associated with how much time people report spending on moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity or watching a screen during their leisure time.'We know that people tend to overreport how much time they spend on physical activity, but around half of the DNA regions we identified also show robust associations with physical activity as measured using devices that people wore during daily life. This adds further credibility to our findings,' says Ruth Loos from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, at the University of Copenhagen.Next, the researchers used DNA variants as instrumental variables and showed that less screen time lowers the risk of obesity. Less screen time and more time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity also protect from diabetes, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and earlier age at death.'We confirmed that physical activity has beneficial effects on health outcomes. We also found that all outcomes that we examined are driven by physical activity's beneficial effect on body mass,' says Zhe Wang from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and first author of the paper.Further analyses showed that DNA variants associated with leisure screen time are more often located close to genes whose activity in skeletal muscle is changed by strength training. This suggests that these genes may influence the likelihood of adopting an active lifestyle by affecting the response to training.The researchers studied one gene in more detail and identified a DNA variant that changes a building block of a protein that is only present in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibres.'Our results show that this change results in more elastic muscle fibres that can deliver less force, but are likely less susceptible to exercise-induced muscle damage. We think that this reduced risk of muscle damage after exercise makes it easier for people to have a more active lifestyle,' says co-author Andrew Emmerich from the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Uppsala University.In total, the researchers identified 46 genes in the 99 DNA regions that could be relevant for linking genetics and physical activity. The findings suggest that pathways related to locomotion and muscle weakness due to dysfunction of the muscle fibre are probably involved.'We cannot currently claim that these 46 genes cause someone to be more or less physically active in daily life, but they provide great leads for further studies. Perhaps in the future it will even be possible to trigger the beneficial effects of physical activity without the need to be physically active,' says Marcel den Hoed, researcher at the Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology at Uppsala University, and lead author of the paper.Read all the Latest Lifestyle News and Breaking News here",The findings show the benefits of physical activity for health and imply that a more sedentary lifestyle might be explained by how muscles adapt to exercise,
"Nokia was never a name that you may have associated with TVs. About a decade ago, Nokia was a different beast altogether - reigning the world of mobile phones with an iron hand. Fast forward to now, and Nokia is barely a shadow of its glorious past. The Finnish giant today licenses its iconic brand name to HMD Global for phones, and now, to Flipkart as a brand licensee for building TVs.Smart TVs, incidentally, are among the most popular categories of gadgets in today's consumer electronics market. As the likes of Xiaomi and TCL brought down smart TV prices across the market, the smart TV industry today has players such as OnePlus and Realme offering smart LED TVs based on Google's Android TV OS. Flipkart, on this note, today licenses the brand names of Nokia and Motorola, once iconic market players, to offer budget smart TVs.At the ongoing Flipkart Big Billion Days sale, the new crop of Nokia smart TVs have premiered at fairly competitive prices. The range starts from a 32-inch HD variant priced at Rs 12,999, 43-inch full HD at Rs 22,999, 43-inch 4K at Rs 28,999, 50-inch 4K at Rs 33,999, 55-inch 4K at Rs 39,999 and 65-inch 4K at Rs 59,999. Each of these TVs feature an integrated range of speakers designed in a sound bar form factor, with Japanese home audio brand Onkyo's name featuring on the sound bar. The TVs run on Android TV 9.0, and feature a host of customisations from Nokia's end to better tune the image quality and the overall usage experience.Does it, then, make sense for you to invest in a 'Nokia' TV at around this price? The variant we reviewed officially carries a lengthy title - 'Nokia 50-inch 4K LED Smart Android TV with Sound by Onkyo', and costs Rs 33,999. It rivals the likes of the Mi TV 4X 50-inch 4K (priced at Rs 31,999), the TCL P715 50-inch 4K (priced at Rs 37,990) and the Motorola 50-inch 4K with wireless gamepad (priced at Rs 31,999). While the pricing is smack in the competitive belt, we look at everything else about this TV.Design: Neat, classy and fairly premiumFirst impressions are always lasting ones, and right out of the box, the Nokia TV looks pretty good. Its overall sleekness is in line with what competing offerings from the likes of TCL and Xiaomi have in the market, and the soft-touch, matte finish looks more premium than its competitors as well. The steel-finish table-top pegs also look upmarket, and more importantly, sturdy. That ensures peace of mind, above everything else, and you know that a slight accidental brush against the TV's frame will not topple it over.I'm personally not the biggest fan of the sort of fabric finish that the Nokia TV has on its integrated Onkyo sound bar. That said, it does look more premium than plastic, although buyers will need to be careful about vacuuming the sound bar lightly in regular intervals to make sure that dust does not get embedded on the front facade. The TV is decently light and easy to set up, and the broad chin (thanks to the sound bar) gives it a generally premium overall design.On overall terms, the Nokia 50-inch 4K LED Android TV is one that you wouldn't really mind seeing sitting on your TV unit or hanging on the wall. At least in terms of looks, it plays its part pretty well.Picture quality: Not the sharpest, but a whole lot of flexibilityThe story is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to the overall picture quality of the Nokia TV. The setup process is fairly uncluttered and straightforward, and right from the onset, you get to see the myriad picture quality and colour tone customisations that Nokia has thrown in. This literally gives you a massive array of customisable options when it comes to the overall picture quality, colour tone, motion smoothing and even audio.It is this massive level of customisations that inspires confidence on the Nokia TV. For instance, you can micro-control colour tone with gamma, hue and a whole bunch of other parameters that you would not find in every Android TV. You can also control how the panel reacts to factors such as motion smoothing, backlight dimming and colour temperature, all of which can be excellent if you are very particular about how the colour on your TV looks like. It is also this particular feature that is the strength of the Nokia TV - you can actively tweak the colour tone settings on the TV to suit your viewing preferences in the morning and later at night.However, the core picture quality of the TV's LED-backlit LCD display panel is not the sharpest in the industry. The 4K content upscaling engine does not work as well as it does in some other TVs, and since most of our content does not play in native 4K quality, the lack of precision in 4K upscaling makes some content, such as the ongoing spree of Indian Premier League cricket matches via Hotstar, appear slightly soft - even when streaming on an uninterrupted, 300Mbps fiber broadband internet line.The slight softness goes away when you play native 4K content, be it BluRay movie copies that you have on your drives or streaming 4K movies from Netflix. Thanks to the exhaustive picture quality controls, you can get just the perfect balance of reds and blues in a frame, and the overall micro-dimming of the LED backlit can produce acceptable blacks as well. It does not hold a candle to the deep blacks that are offered by OLED TV panels, but the cost factor is crucial here. The whites are also not as bright as what QLED TVs can produce, but at this price, the Nokia TV gets the colour tones accurate enough. If only the picture rendering engine performed better at sharpness and visual accuracy, the Nokia TV would have been a clear, direct winner.Software features: The enhancements are a boon in disguiseWhat truly impressed me here are the software enhancements that Nokia is offering with its TV. On the Nokia TV, you get a dedicated 'FastCast' app to stream content from Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices, which essentially covers all categories of smartphone and laptop users. Along with the casting app, you get super handy features baked into the TV. The one I used the most is the music mode, where I could simply play my favourite YouTube playlist while working, and turn on the mode to switch off the display.This feature will work wonders for those who do not have a portable speaker handy in their room at all times, hence allowing users to use the Onkyo sound bar as a room speaker only. Other features include a night viewing mode that dims the display by about 20 percent - while this is good, I wish there was some customisability that allowed me to choose how much I could dim the display. There is also a sleep mode, using which you can play your favourite Spotify podcast or any music playlist, turn on sleep and music modes in tandem, and doze off. This would allow you to fall asleep listening to your favourite audio tracks, and have the TV switch itself off after 20 minutes, on its own.The overall software enhancements combined with remote shortcuts also allow you to adjust picture and audio quality on the fly without pausing live streams. If you have lived with Xiaomi's Patchwall TV interface and don't particularly enjoy having to step out of the content stream to adjust your picture or backlight, this can prove to be a lifesaver.Also Watch :Sound quality: Loud and clear, and fairly decentThe Nokia 4K LED Android TV features an integrated sound bar that is seemingly based on Onkyo drivers. The setup features 48W audio, with a 30W 'QuatroX' speaker and 18W tweeters. The speakers have Dolby Audio and Onkyo surround sound certification, and for integrated TV speakers, the overall audio performance is quite impressive.It does not particularly offer surround audio per se, so spatial distribution is not its strength here. However, what impresses is the overall loudness without sounding too tinny. The speakers do not sound as deep and warm as dedicated sound bars do, but for content such as sports and regular TV soaps, it offers reasonable warmth that makes sure that you do not need an audio upgrade to go with the TV. However, theatrical movies such as films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe will not sound as earth-shaking with the integrated speakers.Frankly speaking, it would also be wrong to expect an integrated sound bar of a budget LED TV to offer deep, warm integrated audio the way Sony's flagship OLED TVs do.Remote: Slight learning curve, but ergonomically handyThe bundled, Bluetooth-based remote control is now sleeker than Nokia's older generation TV remotes. It is clearly plasticky, but does not feel too cheap or flimsy. The remote offers shortcut buttons for Netflix and Zee5, the latter being unusual to spot. The buttons are fairly tactile, but are a tad on the tighter side. The most important button on the remote is the settings shortcut to the top-right, which allows for picture quality control on the fly. There's nothing particularly exceptional to write about the new Nokia remote, except that functionally, it is fairly ergonomic. There is a slight learning curve in terms of the button layout and adjustment, but nothing that you can't get accustomed to.Verdict: Software enhancements making up for the consOn overall terms, the Nokia 4K LED Android TV is reliable. It offers an excellent array of picture quality adjustments, and while the panel's slightly lower overall sharpness is a major con, it will not bother you unless you are super finicky about how your TV exactly looks like. Its vast array of software features give plenty of convenience, and at Rs 33,999 for a 50-inch TV (and Rs 39,999 for 55-inch), the Nokia 50-inch 4K LED Android Smart TV can definitely be in your shortlist for best smart TVs at this price.However, if outright picture quality is the most important for you, Xiaomi and TCL's TVs are better bets for you to go with.Read all the Latest News and Breaking News here","The Nokia 50-inch 4K LED Smart TV comes with integrated speakers branded under Onkyo which sounds good, but the real winner is its list of features.",
"New Delhi: Supporters of JD(U) rebel Sharad Yadav on Thursday announced the formation of Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), a new political outfit that marks a formal split in the Nitish Kumar-led party. The announcement was made by LJD national secretary Sushila Morale at a press conference where Yadav was also present, but he insisted that he was not yet a member of the new party as his legal claim to represent the JD(U) was still sub-judice. Yadav, however, said that the LJD would have his blessings. A national conference of the newly-formed outfit will be organised on May 18 and Yadav will be present for it as a margadarshak (mentor), Morale told reporters here. However, she categorically stated that Yadav would not be a part of the new party. A case is pending before the Delhi High Court in connection with the claim staked on the JD(U)'s arrow symbol by the Sharad Yadav-led faction after the Election Commission rejected its plea for granting it the symbol. In December last year, Yadav had also moved the Delhi High Court seeking the setting aside of his disqualification from the Rajya Sabha.","The announcement was made by LJD national secretary Sushila Morale at a press conference where Sharad Yadav was also present, but he insisted that he was not yet a member of the new party as his legal claim to represent the JD(U) was still sub-judice.",A national conference of the newly-formed outfit will be organised on May 18 and Yadav will be present for it as a margadarshak (mentor).

"The Uttar Pradesh government intends to build a high-speed metro link between the upcoming Noida International Airport in Jewar and Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport. According to Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL) officials, the high-speed metro project via the Airport Express Line may have only six stations to ensure a quick commute on the 72km long line.Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary DS Mishra will preside over a high-level meeting to finalise the detailed project report (DPR) on June 14. As per NIAL officials, the meeting will include DMRC, the Yamuna Motorway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida), NIAL; the Ministry of Civil Aviation; and the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited among others, to finalise the stations in this mega metro corridor project. The meeting will also discuss the funding pattern.Previously, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had proposed 12 stations on the corridor, which will run from the New Delhi Metro interchange, where the Airport Express Line begins, to the Noida airport in Jewar. 'The Uttar Pradesh government wants only six metro stations on this project so that it takes only half an hour to get from Jewar to New Delhi station,' stated an unnamed Uttar Pradesh government official as per Hindustan Times report.Meanwhile, Arun Vir Singh, CEO of NIAL and Yeida said that DMRC proposed 12 stations along the corridor that will run from Jewar airport to the New Delhi metro station in a previous draft, the report added. However, adding more stations will slow down the corridor's speed. Hence, NIAL proposed six metro stations along the corridor to allow passengers to travel rapidly between the two airports, Singh added.The UP government and Yeida will provide multimodal connectivity from Jewar to IGI airport under the terms of the agreement signed by the Jewar airport concessionaire Company, the Zurich International AG of Switzerland, Yamuna International Airport Private Limited, and Noida International Airport Limited. This is because Noida Airport is scheduled to start operations on September 29, 2024.The upcoming project connecting Delhi's IGI Airport to Jewar Airport in Noida is expected to be built at a cost of around Rs 13,000 crore.",The UP government wants only six metro stations on this high-speed line so that it takes only half an hour from Jewar to reach New Delhi railway station,"Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL) officials, the high-speed metro project via the Airport Express Line may have only six stations to ensure a quick commute on the 72km long line."
"With stone-pelting incidents on the Vande Bharat trains under the spotlight, the Railway Ministry said that on average per day four such cases were reported during the three-year period between 2020 and 2022. In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha on Friday, the ministry said that a total of 4,233 incidents of stone-pelting on trains were reported over the Indian Railways during the last three years-2020, 2021, and 2022.Also, the ministry said that during the same period, Indian Railways suffered a loss of about Rs 262 crore due to damage/destruction to railway property during agitations. In 2020, this loss was Rs 1.78 crore, in 2021 it was Rs 0.68 crore and in 2022 it was highest at Rs 259.44 crore.The ministry said that it has issued detailed guidelines regarding action to be taken to control incidents of stone-pelting on moving trains.'Analysis of these incidents followed by substantive action is taken to curb these incidents…Regular drives are conducted against anti-social elements like drunkards, mischievous elements in the affected section/black spots and the apprehended persons are prosecuted under legal provisions of law,' it said.The ministry also said that the train escorting parties have been sensitised to remain more vigilant in the vulnerable sections/spots, where incidents of vandalism on trains are frequently reported.Also, various awareness programmes including Operation Sathi are conducted regularly in inhabited areas adjacent to railway tracks to sensitise people towards the menace of stone pelting and its consequences.In order to safeguard the lives of passengers and damage to Railway Property due to vandalism by miscreants, the authorities collect and share inputs with all intelligence agencies.'Cyber patrolling and collection of technical intelligence using modern technological tools is being done to collect inputs on these types of activities.

"Parliament has become one of the most active protest sites, consuming a major part of its scheduled working hours. It sits for 60 to 70 days a year, divided into three sessions - budget, monsoon and winter - while both the houses work from 11 am to 6 pm with an hour's recess.This year's monsoon session began on Thursday and, much like in the recent past, was finally adjourned for the day amid repeated protests. Opposition parties protested over the unrest in Manipur - demanding discussions in the lower and upper houses - and the prime minister's statement on it. So, it's not surprising that the session for both houses, once again, began on a stormy note.Parliament performance in 2023, so farAccording to data from PRS Legislative Research, the productivity rate of the budget session, which usually performs well, hit rock bottom. Lok Sabha could work only for 33 percent of its scheduled working hours while it was 24 percent for the Rajya Sabha. Before this, the budget session had recorded such a poor performance in 2018 - 21 percent for Lok Sabha and 27 percent for Rajya Sabha.Both the houses of Parliament had 25 sitting days. The lower house could work for 46 hours, losing 96 hours due to interruptions and adjournments. The upper house had a worse record - 32 hours and 14 minutes with 109 hours lost to disruptions.There was much brouhaha over Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's comments in London that he made against the BJP-led central government. Some opposition parties, including the Congress, protested over the Hindenburg report against the Adani Group and even demanded a probe by a joint parliamentary committee (JPC).17th Lok Sabha: Productivity rates from 2019 to 2022Data shows that the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha began on June 17, 2019, with an oath and affirmation by new members as well as the selection of the speaker of the house. The first session of Rajya Sabha, during the 17th Lok Sabha or its 249th session, began three days later on June 20. Lok Sabha had 37 sittings while the Rajya Sabha had 35.The session saw over 100 percent productivity. Data shows the lower house worked 135 percent over its scheduled working hours. The upper house, too, used all its working hours giving a 100 percent productivity rate.The LS was expected to sit for 280 hours and added another 73.14 hours with late hour sittings. The RS, meanwhile, was expected to sit for 195 hours and 35 minutes but lost 19 hours and 12 minutes due to interruptions and adjournment; it made up for this by adding late hour sittings.Productivity of the 2019 winter session was excellent as well. It was 111 percent for Lok Sabha and 92 percent for Rajya Sabha but productivity rate was low for sessions during 2020 and 2021 - the pandemic years - due to the Covid crisis. The performance was adversely impacted due to reduced number of days, large number of absentees, lack of debate while passing legislations and cancellation of a session.The 2020 budget session was supposed to have 31 sittings but sat for only 23 days. Parliament was adjourned sine die on March 23, 2020, and, hence, Lok Sabha's productivity level stood at 86 percent while it was 74 percent for Rajya Sabha.The monsoon session was delayed and began on September 14, 2020. It was supposed to end on October 1, 2020, but was concluded earlier on September 23, 2020. The 10-day session registered productivity at 145 percent in the lower house and 99 percent in the upper house. The winter session was cancelled.All three sessions were held in 2021. Productivity of LS and RS during the budget session was at 107 percent and 90 percent, respectively. The session usually begins with the presentation of the union budget and related financial bills and is expected to be the most productive of all three sessions.But productivity drastically came down in the monsoon session, which began on July 19, 2021, and was concluded two days ahead of its last working day. Protests by opposition parties demanding discussions on farm laws and farmers' protests, price rise and Pegasus scandal brought productivity down to 21 percent in Lok Sabha and 29 percent in Rajya Sabha.In the 2021 winter session, 12 MPs were suspended for their unruly behaviour during the monsoon session. It fuelled the opposition parties' protests but this session performed better on the productivity scale. The lower house worked for 77 percent of its allotted time while it was 43 percent for the upper house.The year 2022 followed the 2021 trend. Productivity of the LS during the budget session was 123 percent while it was 90 percent for the RS. It came down to 47 percent for the former and 42 percent for the latter during the monsoon session.Lok Sabha lost 54 working hours while Rajya Sabha lost 76 due to interruptions and adjournments. The session was supposed to end on August 12, 2022, but disruptions forced it to be concluded on August 8, 2022.Rival parties protested on price rise and GST imposition on some essential commodities. The winter session performed better with the lower house having a productivity rate of 88 percent while it was 94 percent for the upper house.",Parliament was adjourned for the day following repeated protests by Opposition parties over the Manipur violence and PM Narendra Modi's statement to the media,
"New Delhi: As the Narendra Modi government braced itself for the vote on the no-confidence motion on Friday, it was Telugu Desam Party's Jayadev Galla who moved the motion. Though not many in Delhi may have heard of the Guntur MP, he is a millionaire 60 times over and a successful politician with foreign education to boot. TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu wanted 52-year-old Jayadev to open the debate in Lok Sabha, though another MP Kesineni Srinivas originally moved the motion. The TDP has just 13 minutes allotted to take part in the debate. This shows how much Naidu trusts Galla and not just because he is extremely articulate. This indicated he may be nurtured to take on a larger role. He is among the emerging group of industrialist-politicians in Andhra Pradesh, foreign-educated millionaires who run big industrial groups and have entered electoral politics. They are in their late 40s or early 50s. Jayadev is boss of Amara Raja group of companies, set up by his NRI father who returned to India from the US three decades ago. The 'Amaron' battery is the flagship product of this group which is diversified into several other fronts. In the 2014 elections, Jayadev declared personal assets worth Rs. 683 crores. He is from Chittoor and is married to Padmavathi, daughter of Telugu film star Krishna. His wife, thus, brings with her economic and political clout that her maternal family has at their command. His leader, Chandrababu Naidu, is also from Chittoor, barely 50 km from where Jayadev was born. Jayadev's father, Ramachandra Naidu, studied in the US and worked there for over two decades, before returning to Chittoor and starting the Amara Raj group of companies.

"New Delhi: With all eyes on the no-confidence motion underway in Parliament, the opposition parties pressed for more time in order to debate the motion. Presiding over the proceedings, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan announced that the trust vote would be held at 6 pm with both NDA and opposition parties getting seven hours to debate the motion. Congress' MP Mallikarjun Kharge criticised the short time given to argue the motion. Requesting the speaker to not put a time limit on the debate, the MP said that no-confidence motions have been known to stretch for over two days in history. The BJP has been allotted 3 hours and 33 minutes to speak while the Congress has been allotted 38 minutes. Referring to the time allotted, Kharge said that 38 minutes were not enough for the party to voice the issues of 130 crore Indians. Even Telugu Desam Party MP Galla Jayadev, who initiated the discussion on the motion on Friday, said that in the history of no-confidence motions, no one has ever given a speech under an hour long. However, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar slammed the Opposition parties for attempting to parry for more time, claiming that Kharge was trying to play Test cricket during a one-day match. With the BJD staging a walk out and BJP ally Shiv Sena announcing that it will stay away from Parliament to symbolise its opposition of the BJP, the total number of the Lok Sabha has reduced to 495. The majority mark is 249 votes. At the beginning of the discussion, the Speaker had offered to skip lunch to be able to meet the 6 pm target for the vote. But with speeches extending their prescribed time limits, the voting is expected to take place after than 6 pm.","Congress' MP Mallikarjun Kharge criticised the short time given to argue the motion.

"As India assumes the presidency of the G-20, are we focusing enough on the one ingredient that is usually the most overlooked in our national armoury of putting our best put forward on the international stage: Soft Power.It is essential to remember that India is as much a nation as it is a civilisation. As an independent Republic, we are young; as a civilization, we are among the most ancient. As a nation we are the world's largest democracy; as a civilization, we have evolved on the basis of moulik soch, the power of original thought. Thus, we have all the ingredients to become a soft power superpower. But to do this we have to give this vital goal the attention it deserves, and the planning and resources that it requires.Antiquity, continuity, diversity, assimilation and peaks of refinement mark our civilisation. In the present, our nation's survival as a democracy is a remarkable achievement, given the dire predictions being made in 1947 of how long this will last, considering the size and complexity of India. But even though many other newly independent countries soon jettisoned democracy, we did not. What is even more remarkable is that we managed to chalk up economic growth while remaining a democracy. True, our economic development could have been faster, more inclusive, and substantive. True also that our democratic functioning is not blemish-less, and needs reforms. But the fact is that the Great Indian Experiment has not failed. We have remained a democratic nation, and our civilisational legacy is still intact.There is much, therefore, that India can, through its soft power, project to the world, especially when we are hosting the meeting of the twenty most powerful nations of the world. A myth that needs to be busted is that soft power and hard power are antithetical to each other. Actually, they are complementary. Each reinforces the other. Hard power is in your face, statistically verifiable, and data-driven. Soft power requires imagination, creativity, subtlety, and ingenuity to be projected credibly. This requires a special vision.One thing is certain: Bollywood and chicken tikka cannot be our principal brand ambassadors to the world. I have nothing against either. In fact, I quite enjoy having a tikka or two while watching a Bollywood film. But that is not the point. A civilisation that has so much to offer in terms of the richness of its cultural artefacts and the profundity of its spirituality and philosophy, must seriously broad base its cultural projection. In doing this, the stage is past when we relied mostly on periodic cultural performances and exhibitions to showcase our heritage. The time has come to explain to the world, in an organised, planned and sustained thrust, the amount of cerebral energy that has for millennia gone into the unique tradition of our music, dance, sculpture, architecture, painting, literature, theatre, textiles, and myriad forms of craftsmanship. We need to explain the deep philosophy and thought underlying our entire spectrum of artistic endeavours, and the fact that India was the first civilisation to develop the science of aesthetics, rasa, on which there is an entire chapter in Bharat's Natya Shastra, written in 200 BCE. Performance and explication must go together, including through short films, competent guides and lecture-demonstrations, to take the appreciation of our soft power beyond exotica to genuine respect.Second, we need to allocate resources. The Ministry of Culture is inadequately budgeted, and even the meagre amount allotted to it is not fully spent. Institutions like the Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR) — which like the British Council, United States Information Service (USIS), the Goethe Institute of the Germans, Mexico's Cervantes Institute and China's Confucius Centres — is meant to propagate Indian cultural abroad, has little or no money beyond fixed administrative needs. For a country whose calling card since the dawn of time is culture, this is a dismal commentary. Obviously, things cannot be rectified overnight, but a concerted and innovative attempt needs to be made — beyond more of the routine — to more meaningfully and comprehensively project our civilisational soft power during our G-20 presidency, and new plans for this need to be drawn up immediately.The second aspect of soft power is political. The world respects India because it is a democracy, and sui generic in the manner in which it has been a crucible for plurality, diversity, tolerance, co-existence and inclusion, a country which is multi-ethnic, multicultural, and multi-religious. The challenge here is to demonstrate our unity in diversity. It is a colonial argument that India is just a collation of sporadic diversities created into a nation by the British. What we have to project is a celebration of our diversity while simultaneously stressing our civilisational unity. This is a sophisticated project, and cannot be achieved merely by verbal hyperbole. It requires deep application of mind, so that the net impression gathered by our distinguished foreign dignitaries is, that as a nation-civilisation we are as much as a salad bowl as a melting pot, where diversities flourish yet meld into one verifiable whole.The G-20 presidency provides an opportunity to completely revamp the priority we have thus far given to soft power, and radically restructure the manner in which we pursue it. This will pay us dividends, not only during the G-20, but thereafter, and help considerably in giving India its real place as the cradle of civilisation, which deserves the title of Vishwa Guru.The author is a former diplomat, an author and a politician.

"What is FE? Is this a new phone? Is it a spinoff? Is it a Lite option? You will perhaps have these questions about the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE. The latest smartphone to join the Samsung Galaxy S20 line-up of phones, available in India. Before we get down to the actual review, it is important to answer the very first question right away. FE stands for Fan Edition. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, short for Samsung Galaxy S20 Fan Edition, is Samsung bringing back the FE moniker after a few years gap. We last saw it with the Galaxy Note FE. But what is so special about the Fan Edition, or FE? Actually, you may have heard this before. After all. Pretty much every smartphone maker claims to listen to customer and user feedback (many lovingly refer to these folks as fans) and try to incorporate that in the subsequent phones that they make. Yet, it is Samsung which is proudly stating that this is a phone made based on fan feedback. It might just make a lot of sense too, in these tough times.Let us look at what the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE brings to the table, now that all the customer feedback has been taken, put into a blender, and out emerges this recipe. Globally, there will be two variants, one with 5G and one without 5G. India gets the latter, and we really cannot hold it against Samsung because when we look at the complete Galaxy S20 line-up, you have the 5G options as well if that is what you choose. Apart from that bit, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE line in India is simple. It is a grand total of one variant. You really cannot get confused with the 6GB RAM and 128GB storage configuration that you get to pick. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is priced at Rs 49,999 in India. This now joins the Samsung Galaxy S20 which is priced from Rs 70,499 as well as the Samsung Galaxy S20+ which costs Rs 87,999 onwards (Read review here) and the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra that is priced from Rs 97,999 (Read review here). We had expected the Galaxy S20 FE to become the entry point into the Galaxy S20 line-up. And it has, by further driving the entry price point lower than before.To answer the other questions posed at the very beginning—the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a new phone, it is not a spin-off and it most certainly isn't some corner-cutting Lite option. That also means this in a way is in competition with the new OnePlus 8T. The two variants are priced at Rs 42,999 (8GB RAM + 12GB storage) and Rs 45,999 (12GB RAM + 256GB storage). Read the OnePlus 8T review to find out what upgrades the 8T brings to the table.Is The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE Just For The Fans?What you do get with the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE from the outset, as a defining factor, are a bunch of colour options, more youthful colours, so to say. There is the Cloud Lavender, Cloud Mint, Cloud Navy, Cloud White and Cloud Red. Cloud, in Samsung's scheme of smartphone colours, means a matte finish. Though I have to say, these colours aren't exclusively meant for the youth, and pretty much any age demographic who likes a phone with a nice personality will find these worth a second look. And a very big change from the Cosmic line-up of colours that the existing line-up of Galaxy S20 phones offer, including Cosmic Black and Cosmic Gray.Also Watch:Design: A Slight Detour From The UsualAs it sits alongside the Samsung Galaxy S20, the Samsung Galaxy S20+ and the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE does things a bit differently. It has no qualms about rocking a polycarbonate back, albeit with what is a glass-like finish. What we have photographed here is the Cloud Mint variant. Unlike glass, this finish does hide smudges and fingerprints quite easily—something I had sort of forgotten having reviewed phone after phone with glass backs. Ah, the simpler things in life. While it is a polycarbonate back, the frame is metal which adds a nice bit of solidity to the entire package. That being said, I'm not exactly sure how the potential buyers would react to the polycarbonate back, considering they may feel this is a step down from the glass and metal backs. The bezels around the display are very slim, and when you look at the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE from the front, it has the definite Galaxy S20 resemblance. As it should.Even though it isn't a glass back, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE has wireless charging, full 15-watts of it. And reverse wireless charging too, if you happen to own a pair of wireless earbuds, for instance. So really, you probably wouldn't it that much that this doesn't have a glass back.Even though the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is now the most affordable phone in the Samsung Galaxy S20 line-up, it isn't cutting any corners on the build. It is well built and is very handy for what is a fairly large 6.5-inch screen size. There is no denying that this feels great to hold. Perplexingly though, this tips the weighing scales at 190 grams, which is more than the Galaxy S20's 163 grams. Yet this feels light enough, and well balanced too. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is IP68 dust and water resistant as well. There is no 3.5mm headphone jack, and it is a bit hard to imagine that the fans feedback suggested that—but then again, you never know.Display: Balancing The Requirements And The UnnecessaryThe 6.5-inch OLED display is Infinity-O, which means this spec is at par with its elder siblings. However, you are restricted with certain compromises in comparison. Mind you, there will have to be a balance between what fans demand and what the accountant suggests is prudent. That is what Samsung have done with the display that is Full HD+, which means a resolution of 2,400 x 1,080 pixels. To be honest, this is the resolution that the other Samsung Galaxy S20 series phones also offer in the display settings and offers the ideal balance between visual brilliance and battery consumption. I, for one, will not be holding the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE's display resolution against it. At all.Not to forget, this display ticks off the 120Hz refresh rate spec as well, which is right in tune with the times. Everything just looks better at 120Hz. By default, you may find that the colours on this screen are a tad too rich, but head to the display settings and you can easily tone this down as per your liking—Natural mode perhaps seems the best fit. Also, I have to note that there have been absolutely no inconsistent touch issues with the display on our review unit of the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE.Camera: Don't Go By Megapixels, This Triple Camera Setup Is Very GoodIt is hard to also imagine that fans and users wanted a camera system step-down, at least comparatively. While the Samsung Galaxy S20 starts out with a 64-megapixel + 12-megapixel + 12-megapixel cameras, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE instead makes do with 12-megapixel ultrawide camera + 12-megapixel wide camera + 8-megapixel telephoto camera. You might be worried about the fact that Samsung has swapped out the higher megapixel sensor. On paper, 12-megapixel isn't the same as 64-megapixel. Yet, I must say the camera holds its own, more easily than you'd perhaps imagine. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE's photography results, indoors and outdoors in good light and low light, are really impressive. Photos are bright but that doesn't mean the dynamic range is compromised, there is a nice vibrancy to images that a lot of people prefer when they share photos on social media and when you zoom in, you'd see a lot of detailing too. The software side of things is doing more than its share to help the camera hardware along, without any overtly aggressive colour boost. Even with the Night Mode switched off, the large pixels capture enough light to allow excellent details to show up. That means the results will show much better highlights, a tad more crispness and areas around a possible light source in the photo will retain the detailing that may otherwise have been lost. I really like how the software has dialled down the noise reduction to eliminate grain—something that helps retain details elsewhere in the frame.That being said, the 30x zoom feature looks great on paper, but you'd be very lucky to get usable photos at that range. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE returns good zoom results till 10x of which 3x is optical zoom, and you can even get up to 20x if you have really stable hands. Any zoom level beyond that requires the phone to be mounted and absolutely static to be able to at least eliminate some noise.Also remember though, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE cannot do 8K video recording, which to be honest, absolutely isn't something I'd spend any more time on.At the front is a 32-megapixel with Quad Bayer sensor, and that's is a big step up from the 10-megapixel front camera in the Galaxy S20 and the Galaxy S20+. Do note though, this doesn't have autofocus, but for video recordings and even video meetings, this really didn't pose a problem for me.Performance: Flagship Specs and Flagship-esque ExperienceThe Samsung Galaxy S20 FE that we can buy in India runs the same Exynos 990 processor as the Samsung Galaxy S20 phones and even the Galaxy Note 20 series. The phone that you buy in India does not have 5G. In terms of the brute processing power, this will be at par with the other Samsung Galaxy S20 series phones. But we must factor in the 6GB RAM (there is no 8GB or 12B option here), which still gets you enough headroom with multitasking, apps and games.On the software side of things, it's the familiar Samsung One UI that we see on all other Samsung Galaxy S20 series phones as well. The thing is, One UI just works. Be it in terms of the visual appeal, the extensive feature set that doesn't overwhelm you and the slick add-ons such as the DeX interface. For me, One UI has also become incredibly familiar. Yet, the sameness of it all just feels a little out of place—some tweaks, perhaps even some vibrant accent colours, may have allowed the FE aspect to stand out a bit more. It is easy to understand why Samsung doesn't want to change what is working well, but just that added flavour will perhaps be appreciated by customers who want to stand out from the routine.The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE also gets a large 4,500mAh battery, which is actually bigger than the 4,000mAh battery that the Samsung Galaxy S20 packs in. This, for me, actually almost lasted two days on a single charge when used moderately. Dial up the app usage, multi-tasking and even some video streaming, and yet this will easily last you a day without any need for battery anxiety.What irks a bit is that the phone is shipped with the slower 15-watt charger, while it can go all the way up to 25-watt fast charging. You will want a faster charge, and you will need to spend more for that.The Last Word: Samsung Galaxy S20 FE Really Makes Sense In More Ways Than OneThe success of the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE was always going to be dependent on the pricing. At Rs 49,999 and even lower if you snare the right deals. In a way, this will become the new entry point to the Samsung Galaxy S20 smartphone line-up. And a very good one at that.Financial prudence seems to be a sign of the times for a lot of potential buyers. Smartphone companies are, in an understanding of the slightly complicated times we are living in, perhaps best indicated in different ways and at different price points by the likes of the OnePlus Nord, the Google Pixel 4a and even the OnePlus 8T, at different points of time this year. Which is why, robust yet a tad more affordable phones are the way forward, at least this festive season.For Samsung, the Galaxy S20 FE plugs into that mission, perfectly. It is a Galaxy S20 phone, inside and out. It has flagship specs, and it feels latest gen by the experience, performance and a sprightly personality. Lower price tag isn't leading you unwillingly to the doorstep of compromise, and to be honest, the lack of glass and metal isn?t really a compromise once you see the finish it gets. Nor is the lack of 5G, for most users. And it allows Samsung to have another option, widening the price range of the Galaxy S20 line-up and making it more affordable, without having to re-price any of the excellent existing Galaxy S20 phones.Read all the Latest News and Breaking News here",The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE makes the Galaxy S20 smartphone experience all the more accessible.

"Some of what British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said on university courses that lead nowhere we all know. That there are certain courses students pursue out of interest, that are not the most job-friendly. History, for instance. A student fired by ambitions of becoming the CEO of Apple one day is not likely to opt for mediaeval history. Sunak has not exactly said that history will be taken off a university syllabus. But his announcement to axe courses that lead to few jobs threatens several cousins of a history course that students pursue more for interest than for ambition.The government has been careful not to spell out what some of these courses are. That would lead to specific challenges to such decisions that the government is not prepared to take on immediately but will have to eventually if the government were to go ahead. Any such decision would necessarily narrow education in Britain into utilitarian purposes from its more broad-based span at present. This then starts off a debate about what education should mean, and both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have challenged this policy already.But there is a subtext here that takes the debate from education to immigration.A number of such courses do not attract enough students - most students themselves are already as utilitarian-minded as the government would like them to be. That makes admission to such courses a little easier for foreign students. Closure of such courses would limit the number of foreign students coming to Britain for any kind of study at all. And a reduction in those numbers would to that extent feed into the claim the government has promised to make of a reduction in migration by the end of the year.That reduction is at present quite out of line with what Rishi Sunak has promised - ahead of the general election early next year. A tightening for students has been indicated already, and the move to restrict courses on offer is only a step to deliver the immigration promise.In this, the government will have the universities themselves challenging it. Not necessarily because they are ideologically committed to diversity in knowledge but because the diversity of students that come to these courses from abroad brings fees that keep the universities going. This is then less about commitment to knowledge than about the very existence of many universities.The threat is not really to well-established universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, and The London School of Economics. It is the 'new universities' that would lose out. These were the old polytechnics that former prime minister Margaret Thatcher renamed universities. And they have thrived under that title by attracting substantial numbers of foreign students, principally from India and China. A number of these students are prepared to go for any course in any university, new or not so new, that they can get if they do not get their prime choices.These are the courses, and those are the universities that the new policy will hit hardest. And this the government has set out to do for its own reasons, not all to do with education.","UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced to axe courses that lead to few jobs, a move that would limit the number of foreign students coming to Britain",
"Atindriya Bose, country manager for Sony Playstation India, is looking to lure India's burgeoning mobile gaming community with Sony's range of gaming products. Q. Why hasn't the gaming boom taken place in India yet? Is it to do with price? People use price to compare console gaming to other electronic segments because it's the most obvious way to categorise, but Indian purchasing power parity can be sliced and diced into many different economies. Q. Was the PlayStation 4 (PS4) launch substantial to the gaming market in India? Yes. Q. Has it gone mass? No, it hasn't. In electronics, there are factors outside price [the PS4 was launched at Rs 39,990]. Telephones and TV became big in India on the basis of a low running cost and improved infrastructure: 300 channels got beamed with high quality content and it resulted in people wanting to enjoy it. With mobile phones, your value-added services and call costs and call-drops have fallen drastically. Everyone would love to have console prices where they're not constrained to a one shot payment. Between 2002 and 2007, when we launched in India, when Microsoft launched as well [with the Xbox], it was a market-building effort. I think now it's nicely positioned into verticals. There are more gamers and each gamer is a marketer for you: He brings in three more gamers into the fold. The mass base has broadened over the last 1.5 years at a speed that the PS alone could never had done, thanks to the tablet and smartphone revolution. Younger gamers are also realising that mobiles games are repetitive and without deriding those games, mass gamers are looking for more immersive, deep gaming experiences. Going forward, it will be about how we give the mobile gaming population a taste of the layers and depth in PlayStation titles. For example, Crash Bandicoot on PlayStation Mobile is one of our best-selling titles! Over a period the value equation will also fall into place: People say our games are Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 and they can get mobile games for free or pay Rs 99 to Rs 199. What they aren't comparing is a 26-hour versus a 1-hour [respectively] game experience. The PlayStation network and store allows you to download snackable games like mobile games because of the internet infrastructure that now exists. The indie [independent] game developers will play a very important role along with the big developing studios because they can deliver low-GB games at Rs 250 to Rs 500. Q. What is the size of the console gaming market in India? It is estimated between Rs 700 crore and Rs 750 crore at the consumer level: Rs 450 crore for hardware and Rs 250-300 crore for software. On top of that you have PC gaming. Mobile is a different industry altogether. On the hardware side, we are almost 75 to 80 percent of the market. In the Rs 300-350 crore software market, as publisher, Sony Computer Entertainment is about 20 to 25 per cent of the market. A console is a gaming device because of the content, not the machine, so it's important all the publishers' titles are available at the right prices. We did a study five to six months ago: Almost 55 to 60 million Indians claim they are regularly gaming-this grew thanks to the mobile, the previous study had just 27 million! Advanced gamers who download games come to 30 million, and they are looking for bigger, better things. In India we have an installed base [owned, purchased consoles] of 1.7 million consoles, which is miniscule but has grown tremendously. The potential is huge: 7 to 8 million people claim to play on a console regularly! So each console owner allows anywhere between four to five people to play on their consoles. Q. Why were you pleasantly surprised by the response to the PS4? Between 2007 and 2012, we had seen business growth at almost 33 to 35 percent CAGR driven by the PS2. In the first 2 hours of the PS4 launch, we sold almost as much stock as the whole of 2013's worth of PS3s!

"The Union Cabinet on Wednesday gave approval to the Data Protection Bill. The initial draft of the Bill was introduced in November of the previous year and underwent several rounds of public consultation. Taking into account the feedback received during these consultations, a second draft was prepared and subsequently underwent inter-ministerial discussions.The Bill will have jurisdiction over the processing of digital personal data in India. This includes data collected online or offline and later digitized. The Bill will also apply to the processing of data outside of India if it involves offering goods or services or profiling individuals in India.Under the Bill, personal data can only be processed for lawful purposes with the individual's consent.

"Karnataka has been famously described as a psephologist's nightmare. The reason? Because till the last moment, the hugely diverse electorate does not decide, let alone reveal, whom it will favour at the hustings. Legend has it that almost 20 percent of the voters remain undecided till the last day, some till they enter the voting booth itself. In such a scenario, predicting the results will be foolhardy, if not hazardous. But that is precisely what I shall venture to do.But, first, let us look at Karnataka's complex and unpredictable caste and community calculus, with no one in the know of the exact figures. Lingayats, Vokkaligas, Kurubas and other so-called backward communities, Muslims, Schedule Tribes, Christians, and Brahmins. Power has rotated largely between the first three communities. But the last caste census, whose results have been suppressed, indicates that Lingayats and Gowdas (Vokkaligas) have enjoyed disproportionate power, both being much less than their touted numbers. In fact, the Schedule Castes and Muslims are more than the previously accepted figures. Then there are linguistic and out-of-state vote banks besides the Kannadiga majority. Especially in Bengaluru, where Tamils, Telugus, North and North East Indians make up huge numbers.Now let us bring in the three major regions of the state, with their distinct histories: Coastal Karnataka, South Karnataka, and North Karnataka. Belgaum, Dharwad, and Uttara Kannada coastal Karnataka were part of the Bombay presidency. Dakshina Kannada and Udupi also belong to coastal Karnataka. The major communities here are Bunts, Billavas, Mogaveeras, and Brahmins. South Karnataka is the old heartland of the erstwhile Mysore state. It consists of Mysuru, Mandya, Hassan, Chamarajanagar, and Kodagu. The dominant communities in this region are the Vokkaligas, Lingayats, and a large number of Schedule Castes.North Karnataka consists of swathes of what used to be the Hyderabad princely state, such as Bijapur, Bidar, and Gulbarga. It also includes Belgaum and Dharwad, with their unresolved border issues with Maharashtra, in addition to Gadag and Haveri. Rich with fertile lands and historic monuments, the communities that dominate this region are the Lingayats, Kurubas, and Schedule Castes and Tribes.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, the two major political parties in Karnataka, are in a neck-to-neck battle in the upcoming assembly elections. Voters will cast their ballots on May 10th, with the results expected to be declared on May 13. Both parties, over the last two decades, have strong support bases. The Congress, till 1983, ruled uninterrupted; since then, it has won intermittently. The BJP made more recent inroads into the state, the first in its southwards push. They have been in power for nine years.In the last Assembly elections of 2018, the BJP emerged as the single largest party, winning 104 seats out of 224 seats. The Congress won 80 seats, though it had polled a higher percentage of votes. The BJP, despite being the single largest party, fell short of the majority mark of 113. As a result, the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) entered into an 'unholy alliance,' forming a coalition government, with the support of other parties.But in the general elections of 2019, the BJP struck back with unexpected force. It won all 25 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka, a record for the party. That showed overwhelming support for the repeat Prime Ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi. As if on cue, in 2019, the BJP also formed the government in Karnataka. Then Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy was forced to resign after several Congress and JDS legislators crossed over. He lost the floor test, having lost his majority. The Governor, Vajubhai Vala, invited the BJP, already the largest party in the state, to form the government.BS Yediyurappa, popularly known as BSY, though over 76 years of age, which is against the BJP retirement norm of 75, was sworn in as Chief Minister for the fourth time in July 2019. The fifteen days given to him to prove his majority proved ample. He won with 105 votes, not needing the magic figure of 113, because of several absentees or disqualified members. The governor, a former member of the BJP, was predictably accused of being partisan.But as far as the BJP was concerned, it was sweet revenge. But BSY at 79, too, had to make way in 2021, after the Covid-19 pandemic, for his own protégé and fellow-Lingayat, Basavaraj Bommai. The latter, Karnataka's 23rd CM, was also the son of former Janata Dal Chief Minister, SR Bommai. For the statistically inclined, in its 75 years of history since 1947, the state has had 23 chief ministers of whom only three — all of them from the Congress — could complete their five-year terms. They are S Nijalingappa, D Devaraj Urs, and Siddaramaiah, who is once again a contender.Now to the all-important question: who will win? I will try to answer this in greater detail in the next column, but my basic guess is none will get a clear majority, crossing the magic number of 113. It will be a very close contest between the incumbent BJP and the restive if not resurgent Congress. But the dark horse and the kingmaker remain the JD(S), led by the father-son duo, HD Deve Gowda and HD Kumaraswamy. The good news for the BJP is that as the polling day nears, they are inching ahead in the race, partly due to the Congress' own follies — especially the Bajrangi boomerang.[To be concluded]The writer is an author, columnist, and professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

"The fifth meeting of the National Security Advisors (NSA) of the 'Colombo Security Conclave' (CSC) at the Maldivian capital of Malé will be noted for the induction of Mauritius as a full member, and the continuing observer status of Bangladesh and Seychelles, which in due course are expected to sign in. As it can be visualised, the carefully-crafted toddler steps from its commencement in 2011 has brought the multi-national regional arrangement this far, with a critical name-change from 'Maritime Security Agreement' to 'Maritime and Security Agreement', at the previous Colombo session in 2020, indicating future possibilities.Before CSC, given the complexities of regional equations, India as the inevitable centrifugal force in the neighbourhood Indian Ocean Region (IOR) had kept strategic and security relations bilateral. The failure of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to keep out bilateral issues as the Charter promised had made New Delhi especially wary about multilateral arrangements centred on South Asia, but the post-Cold War geopolitical and geostrategic realities have dictated otherwise. This is true of every other member and observer in the Conclave. India did say early on that the nation would be the 'net-provider of security' in the region, a commitment that it would have to keep, yes, but a commitment it could and should keep only through a consensus approach, as the CSC now indicates.Consensus is the keyIt had all begun with the India-Maldives bi-annual 'Dosti' Coast Guard exercises following the footsteps of India's 'Operation Cactus' military intervention—at invitation—to end the mercenary-led coup-bid against Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom in 1988. Unlike what the original purpose might have indicated, the Dosti exercises were about non-traditional security issues like humanitarian aid and ocean pollution. The continuing ethnic war in Sri Lanka delayed the nation's induction, and the CSC now has expanded the scope beyond non-traditional security; however, carefully keeping conventional security issues and cooperation, like a regional defence cooperation pact, at arm's length.The Sri Lankan consensus centred on emerging geostrategic realities and the need for the nation to keep away from Cold War era-like blocs and thus keep extra-regional powers off its waters and beyond.A real beginning was made—outside India—when ahead of the 2005 presidential polls in Sri Lanka, the competing candidates, namely, incumbent Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, and his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe, indicated the nation's common security priorities without mutual consultations. The Sri Lankan consensus centred on emerging geostrategic realities and the need for the nation to keep away from Cold War era-like blocs and thus keep extra-regional powers off its waters and beyond.As a nation that had commended the Indian Ocean as a 'zone of peace' and campaigned for the same in the early decades of the Cold War, the Sri Lankan political position was understandable. Yet, in the prevailing circumstances, Colombo was not unwilling for a 'defence cooperation agreement' with the larger Indian neighbour, but again the ethnic war was the undoing till its end in 2009.Though there were no listeners in the Indian strategic community when the Rajapaksa regime cried hoarse that on security issues, India was their only choice for a partner, there was a change in the official perception in New Delhi, since. Indian concerns were centred on Sri Lanka choosing China for development funding, especially on the southern Hambantota port, which anyway was offered to India by successive governments in Colombo. India had rightly reasoned that it would be an uneconomic project, but that did not dissuade Sri Lanka, for which it became a passion, derived from its history and heritage.Even otherwise, CSC was not an India-forced decision. If anything, what was a unilateral Sri Lankan consensus evolved into a bilateral consensus involving a common neighbour—the Maldives, on the same line and logic. The intervening Indian involvement in providing rescue and rehabilitation assistance in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami in Maldives and Sri Lanka, prioritising them over India's own losses, and withdrawing the Indian troops as fast as they came, created trust in New Delhi and also erased suspicions that it was angling for a permanent military presence/base as some had thought the Indian Peace Keeping Forces (IPKF) to be.Indian concerns were centred on Sri Lanka choosing China for development funding, especially on the southern Hambantota port, which anyway was offered to India by successive governments in Colombo.India has always rushed help to Bangladesh after destructive cyclonic storms that are periodic, and the 'Himalayan earthquake' in Nepal that was devastating. However, they were all bilateral arrangements. Against this, there's lack of clarity if India sharing intelligence inputs with Sri Lanka on the dastardly 'Easter serial-blasts' of 2019 was a bilateral enterprise or a CSC initiative, as with the three-nation cooperation in busting large-scale drug trafficking in shared waters.India's pondIndia's vision for what can now be justifiably dubbed 'India's pond' began with the External Affairs Ministry (MEA) creating a separate IOR Division, focusing on near-neighbours, the Maldives and Sri Lanka, and then adding Mauritius and Seychelles to the list. In 2019, Comoros, Madagascar, and French Réunion Island, forming the 'mouth' of the Indian Ocean, along with Mauritius and Seychelles, were included to the portfolio of the IOR division.No one is now talking about Comoros and Madagascar joining the CSC. Yet, flanked by India's extended land territories in the Andaman and Lakshadweep Seas on either side, and a friendly US Diego Garcia base sitting in the middle (not to leave out the French sovereignty over Réunion), a security net is taking shape to protect the 'pond' than admirers and adversaries may have thought of. However, such a vision has its limitations, as involving extra-territorial powers has the potential to hamper the very idea of the CSC.Member nations, starting with India, the largest one in the grouping, are well aware of the limitations and also the possibility of a total collapse if any or many of them went outside the scope of the fixed agenda.Yet, unlike the US-led Quad, better still AUKUS, the CSC will remain a regional initiative for regional good, with limited scope and goals, as is to be defined by the commonly-agreed Charter and roadmap. If an expansion of either the membership or the agenda is required, it would be achieved only through the consensus process involving sovereign nations. Member nations, starting with India, the largest one in the grouping, are well aware of the limitations and also the possibility of a total collapse if any or many of them went outside the scope of the fixed agenda.Resource shortageApart from shared concerns in an ever-changing post-Cold War geostrategic scenario, smaller nations, both in the IOR and elsewhere find themselves helpless and hapless in addressing the demands on their resources. A case in point is that of Maldives. Other nations are not far off in terms of inadequacy in meeting the demands of 21st century security paradigm.As Maldivian Defence Minister Mariya Didi, as the host, said in her opening remarks at the Malé session, on 9 March 2022, 'Ocean forms 97.5 percent of the nation's territory'. Though the Defence Minister did not mention it, the country lacks not only financial resources but even human resources to secure such a vast area of open seas, which are also open to the skies. According to a recent official figure, birth rates are falling in the densely-populated capital city of Malé, which accounts for 40 percent of the nation's 450,000 population. External assistance thus becomes inevitable.It is here that the involvement of the Indian neighbour with a huge stake in the security of the region as a whole is being misinterpreted by the political opposition identified with former President Abdulla Yameen, who has launched an 'India Out' campaign, with particular reference to the Indian military presence. The likes of minister Mariya Didi and her government have flatly denied the campaign points, which are mostly unsubstantiated. Similar anti-India sentiments used to be flagged in nations like Bangladesh, where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, 74, does not have a popular heir-apparent or even adversary, making 'leadership vacuum' a real possibility in the future.Yet, there is a need for India as the unnamed leader of the grouping to keep an open mind lest the CSC experiment should fail on a future day just as the three-nation NSA meetings got stalled through much of Yameen's Presidency of Maldives (2013-18). This is going to be the most testing and the trickiest part of the CSC arrangement, and overcoming such seasonal domestic changes through bilateral and institutional mechanisms (alone) would determine the longevity and success of the current scheme, for it to look at the future with confidence and continuity and graded goals beyond the present one, to secure the shared waters without involving 'extra-regional' powers.This article was first published on ORF.

"Televisions are the new smartphones. Over the past 24 months or so, as a consumer, you have seen the options hanging from the wall in front of you at the neighborhood electronics store multiply many times over. There was a time when every brand wanted to make phones. Now it seems every brand wants to make TVs. Including some of those who otherwise only really are known for their phones. Anyway, what all this meant was there was tremendous new competition, particularly at the more affordable price points, for the existing big three TV brands—Sony, Samsung and LG. The thing is, if you really are an eagle-eyed viewer and like your movie and sports viewing experience spot on, most of the newbie 4K TVs in the ever expanding TV space just wouldn't cut it in terms of the overall precision and accuracy. Costs have to be cut at some point, after all. Which leads us to the new Sony Bravia X8000H—does it compromise on the spec sheet and the experience?Sony Bravia X8000H is available in 43-inch, 49-inch, 55-inch, 65-inch, 75-inch and 85-inch screen size options. These are priced at Rs 72,900 going all the way up to Rs 6,99,900. We are reviewing the 55-inch screen size option here, which is priced at Rs 1,06,900. That in a way, for this specific screen size, also pits it against the 55-inch OnePlus TV Q1 Pro, which is priced at Rs 99,900. Both are Android TVs, 4K resolution, support for HDR standards whereas the OnePlus TV Q1 Pro gets a QLED display panel and an 8-speaker configuration to add to the experience. I have often remarked that the OnePlus TV Q1 Pro has been tuned, particularly for the picture quality, very similar to the brilliance that the Sony Bravia TVs benchmarked over the years. This is going to be a tough pick for you.Design: A Bit Of The Bravia Brilliance And Then A Slight ShiftThe design aspect of the Sony Bravia X8000H is a bit of a mix. For starters, it is a typical Sony look. You spot this in someone's living room, and without even looking at the Sony branding, you'll know it is a Sony Bravia TV. Good thing that. There are very thin bezels around the screen and they really do well to stay out of the way when you are watching something on this. Not the thinnest, but a fairly thin TV as well. The TV is made almost entirely of high-quality plastic, which helps in keeping the weight down. But at no point does it really interfere with the overall experience, because unlike a phone, you won't be touching, holding or caressing your TV every day. That being said, I'm not exactly a fan of the new design language, that is if you are using this TV with the table-top stand. This is something I have pointed out with the swarm of more affordable TVs that have flooded the market—the table stand design that is almost as wide as the TV will not work for a lot of users. Sony used to make brilliant table-top stands that integrated down the middle and didn't require a table as wide as the TV itself, which makes this departure a bit more perplexing. secondly, unlike let us say the new OnePlus TV U series which has designed the table stand in such a way that you are able to push the TV all the way back to the wall, the design of the Sony Bravia X8000H's stand leaves a lot of gap between your TV and the wall. So much so, I could fit a Google Home smart speaker there and there was still a gap wide enough to slide a few magazines in. The positive side of this stand design is that it leaves enough ground clearance below the TV for you to slide in a soundbar and it wouldn't get in the way of the screen itself. Secondly, the stand is designed in such a way that you don't have to tighten any screws on the TV itself—you simply attach the stand to its mount and slide that into the fixed slot on the TV. I haven't seen the wall mounting system for this TV. Finally, the cable management system doesn't utilize the feet of the stand to thread the power and HDMI cables through it, and instead has two hooks that bind the cables together—at some point, those wires will show up behind or beneath your TV, even if for a short enough length. My perception about the table stand design aside, it has to be said that the Sony Bravia X8000H looks very refined. The screen and the bezel blend seamlessly when the TV is switched off exhibiting a premium look. There are no shouty or unnecessarily blingy elements on it, much like how Sony leans towards the side of sophistication with their TVs. If you have a table wide enough for this TV to be kept on, even the table stand design shouldn't be a worry for you then. Picture: You Probably Will Not Mind That It Isn't A QLEDAs far as the extensive picture quality tech that Sony bolts on to Bravia TVs, particularly the 4K HDR ones is concerned, the Bravia X8000H has it covered. At least for the most part. You'll get the Sony X1 4K HDR image processor working behind the scenes to improve detailing as well as constantly calculate the contrast and colors. In fact, it is so precise that it looks at even the tiniest of objects in a frame and then treats them accordingly. Then there is the 4K Reality Pro Engine, which boosts resolution for lower resolution content to better match the 4K resolution panel—upscaling doesn't get much more accurate than this. And this is also a Triluminos display, which specifically looks at every image on the screen to reproduce colors that are accurate, natural and most certainly better than TVs without this tech. Last but not least, and this is in line with what you'd expect from a TV range that costs as much, the Sony Bravia X80H also supports Dolby Vision and HDR 10 standards. This is just great, since Netflix in particular now has a lot of Dolby Vision content available. That being said, you do miss out on fancy display tech. Ideally, with the gamut of image processing tech that is already in play, you wouldn't feel like you are missing out on anything. But still, if it is more about playing up the spec sheet for you, the Sony Bravia X8000H has an LED panel, and not a QLED display. That also means blacks aren't exactly the deepest at the default setting, though Sony does give you the Black Level setting slider in the Picture menu to tune it to your preference. There is no local dimming either and instead the frame dimming does the job. This is a fairly bright screen from the outset and doesn't let reflections get in the way—this has a semi matte finish which diffuses some reflections, such as a light fixture somewhere behind you. That's good for brightly lit rooms or daytime TV viewing. The advantage of this panel is that you also get good viewing angles, without colour shift or loss of detailing in case you are looking at this from a side. There are detailed picture settings that really get you to exactly how you will like the TV to look for non-HDR and HDR content. That has always been the strong point of Sony Bravia TVs and that remains very much consistent all through. Standard definition as well as 720p content looks not only more than acceptable on the Sony Bravia X8000H, but the image processing does enough to hide away the artefacts and disturbances without compromising the sharpness. It is with the 1080p content that the Bravia X8000H starts to show what it is really capable of, with great upscaling and excellent sharpness. And when you are watching something that is originally in 4K is when you realize why you spent so much money on the Sony Bravia X8000H. Fast moving visuals are absolutely brilliantly handled with no screen tearing or ghosting—and you have the MotionFlow as well as CineMotion settings to work out exactly how smooth you want this to be. A lot of people don't like the opera effect in TV shows, and this flexibility should work well for them.Sound: The New Speaker Makes Things BetterIt has been a standard complaint with most TVs that the audio experience is just not up to the mark. The OnePlus TV Q1 series bucked that trend, and in most ways, the Sony Bravia X8000H does too. For this, they have designed a new speaker system (you cannot see it because it is hidden inside the TV) which is neither an oval shaped speaker that a lot of TVs cram in, and nor is it a small round speaker that some other TVs have. The result, for most of the content that you will watch, is very balanced sound. Dialogue, details and how loud it can get, all ticked off beautifully. It even has some amount of bass too, something that is missing in most TVs and that really takes away a huge chunk from the TV viewing experience. That being said, you'll probably find the OnePlus TV Q1 Pro has a bit more bass to go with what you are watching, purely because of the detailed array of audio hardware that it packs along. Remote: Could We Go The Minimal Route Please?A remote is your perpetual interface with the TV, and it really cannot be less than top notch. Sony has designed this well enough and the keys, even though there are quite a few, still fall to the range of the fingers easier than you would imagine. You'll get used to his layout also rather quickly. But it not the torchbearer for minimalism as OnePlus TV remotes have proved for some time now, but well, the Sony Bravia X8000H remote feels good, has a nice brushed look and the key press reminds you of the premium experience for a premium TV. The Last Word: It Is Too Close To Call Against The OnePlus TV Q1 ProThe Sony Bravia X8000H is undoubtedly offering a premium TV viewing experience. It has everything that you'd expect from the experience standpoint—4K panel with support for all the HDR standards, slick Android TV, lots of picture tuning tech working in the background and sound that doesn't make you crave for a soundbar. Yet, it is hard to ignore that this is a display panel that isn't a QLED, which is a superior display tech without doubt. Yet in a way, it doesn't seem to matter as far as enjoying a spot of Netflix and some Formula 1 action was concerned. My advice would be, look beyond the spec sheet. In the real world, the Sony Bravia X8000H and the OnePlus TV Q1 Pro are very closely matched. I am just glad I don't have to pick between these two. Having a poorly bank account does save me the trouble!","Sony Bravia X8000H is available in 43-inch, 49-inch, 55-inch, 65-inch, 75-inch and 85-inch screen size options. These are priced at Rs 72,900 onwards. The 55-inch option, priced at Rs 1,06,900 is pitted against the 55-inch OnePlus TV Q1 Pro, priced at Rs 99,900.",
"The Madhya Pradesh High Court has sent a notice to the state government seeking its response on a writ petition filed by the Head of Department, Anthropology at Dr Harisingh Gour University for being forced to withdraw from an international webinar following an unprecedented warning from the police over the proposed presence of 'anti-national' speakers. The university, popularly known as Sagar University since it's located in Sagar district, had to withdraw from the webinar titled 'Cultural and Linguistic Hurdles in the Achievement of Scientific Temper' that was scheduled for July 30-31 this year. The webinar was jointly organised by Montclair State University, US and included Gauhar Raza, former chief scientist CSIR, and Professor Apoorvanand, University of Delhi as prominent speakers.The writ petition was filed by Professor Rajesh Kumar Gautam, HoD Anthropology at the university, after Superintendent of Police, Sagar District Atul Singh wrote to university vice-chancellor on the eve of the webinar, saying the organisers could be booked under Section 505 of the IPC if the event led to law and order problem.The university also faced pressure from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP) to withdraw from the virtual conference. Objecting to the invitation accorded to Professor Apoorvanand and Gauhar Raza, ABVP district convenor Shreeram Richaria wrote to the V-C, threatening to file an FIR.The university and the petitioner, Professor Gautam, eventually withdrew from participation, with the latter moving court.In his petition, Professor Gautam said he was subjected to 'mental agony and embarrassment' and was also 'deprived of the opportunity to add to his academic score under the Academic Performance Indicator, which is counted during promotion as per UGC Regulations and for which one of the criterion is the number of academic seminars/ webinars organised.''A habit cannot be made out by State authority to accept any version of events made out by any group (political or non-political) to try and censor speech and academic seminars. As a result, the Petitioner finds himself severely restricted in his academic freedoms and feels a general 'chilling effect' on speech and actions,' it added.The petitioner feels he has been 'defamed and insulted at the hands of the Respondents. The Petitioner also being a Scheduled Caste individual has been discriminated against in the most illegal and arbitrary manner by the Respondents,' the petition further said.Praying for relief, Professor Gautam in his petition said the SP's letter to the vice-chancellor should be declared arbitrary and illegal.The court has granted the state government three weeks to file its reply.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and Ukraine-Russia War Live Updates here.",Dr Harisingh Gour University in MP's Sagar district had to withdraw from the international webinar after pressure from the ABVP and an unprecedented letter by the police over Gauhar Raza and Professor Apoorvanand's participation as speakers.,

"Green Top has embedded itself like a thorn at the heart of the disengagement process on the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh and is threatening to poison the wider India-China talks aimed at drawing down troops before the winter, government sources have told News18. People's Liberation Army negotiators declined to commit to remove troops from the tactically-significant location near Pangong Lake during the marathon talks held at the Chinese base of Moldo on Sunday. A bush-covered plateau perched at over 5,000 metres on a ridge stretching out from Pangong's north shore, Green Top is one of a handful of locations on which PLA and Indian Army negotiators remain deadlocked despite five rounds of high-level talks. New Delhi hopes parallel diplomatic efforts, involving both the Ministry of External Affairs and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, could help resolve the disputes over Green Top, Patrol Point 17A near Gogra, and Patrol Point 13 near the Depsang Plains. Last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin had said 'most of the bases deployed on the front have completed the evacuation process and the ground conditions are recovering'. He acknowledged the existence of 'remaining outstanding issues'. But, officials say scepticism is mounting in the government about the PLA's willingness to withdraw from all territories it occupied in April. 'The talks have achieved their immediate intent, which was to avoid violence,' a senior intelligence official said. 'The fact that China is still occupying territory it grabbed in April may not be a deal-breaker, but it certainly undermines trust'. PLA commanders, government sources say, are seeking to hold on to Green Top because it offers a clear line of observation over Dhan Singh Post, the main logistics hub for Indian troop movements around Pangong Lake. In the negotiations, the PLA has claimed its position on Green Top is legitimised by the build-up of Indian roads and communications infrastructure in the area—in turn, a response to years of construction work by China. 'Their argument is that India has also violated the status-quo in the Pangong area,' an officer familiar with the talks said. 'This claim has no basis, because all the works India has undertaken are clearly on our own side of the LAC'. From Green Top, connected by road to PLA bases near Sirijap, the PLA is able to observe Indian Army patrols headed out eastwards towards the LAC, thus enabling rapid interdiction. Eight 'Fingers', or ridges, radiating from the north shore of Pangong Lake, are contested by China and India. India claims the LAC runs near Finger 8, west of China's forward bases at Sirijap, and has long despatched patrols to the area. This summer, though, the PLA dug in at Finger 4—where Green Top is located—obstructing Indian patrols from moving westwards. Force levels have thinned significantly all the way to Finger 5, government sources say, but the PLA has continued to maintain its presence at Green Top. India had maintained a permanent position at Finger 7 until the 1999 Kargil war, when it was evacuated to provide troops for the conflict with Pakistan. The PLA then built roads into the sector, ensuring the post could not be re-established. Located in the shadow of Karam Singh Hill—named for the Central Reserve Police Force officer who led the unit involved in a murderous 1959 ambush which claimed the lives of ten Indian personnel—Patrol Point 17A, near Gogra, has emerged as second key point of contestation. Even though troops are no longer engaged in eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation, the PLA has continued to maintain a small presence near Point 17A, instead of pulling back. China long ago pushed into parts of the LAC around Gogra, and the nearby Hot Springs area—notably, building a road that cuts across Indian-claimed territory north of the 6,300 metre Changlung La pass, and then traverses Point 15 to enter the Galwan Valley. Patrol Points, numbered north to south with Point 1 located at the Karakoram Pass, make the physical limits to which Indian soldiers assert their presence on the LAC. To the north of the Galwan Valley—the site of the murderous PLA ambush on June 15 clash, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed—China has continued to build road-works at Point 13. The Indian Army fears the new works could join up with existing roads built on the Indian side of the LAC near Burtsé, and eventually cut off Indian troops seeking to patrol the Depsang Plains. No official maps recording the two sides' claims have been made public, but the scholar P Stobdan has recorded that China asserts rights to 972 square kilometres of territory on the Indian side of the LAC in the Depsang Plains, 176 sq. km. along the Samar Lungpa river, 38 sq. km. at Hot Spring, 13 sq. kilometres in Changlung, 5 sq. km. in Kungkala-Phobrang, 129 sq. km in Sirijap; 24 sq. km in Spanggur, and 25 sq. km. in Dhumtsele'. In addition, there are Chinese claims of 83 sq. km. in the Pangong area, and 80 sq. km. in Chumar. 'The territories China is trying to hold on to all lie in the disputed zones,' a senior government official said. 'In the event they do not vacate them, there will be good reason for suspicion about their course of action, going forward'. Future talks, the official said, will focus on re-instituting patrols, suspended by both armies after the violent clash in the Galwan Valley, and creating a system to avoid face-offs between troops. New Delhi has been seeking wider discussions to firm up the LAC, but several proposals to engage in border-demaraction have been rejected by China.","Scepticism is mounting in the government about the PLA's willingness to withdraw from all territories it occupied in April, officials say.",
"Union home minister Amit Shah is scheduled to hold a crucial meeting of core group of BJP's Telangana unit on Tuesday to finalise the strategy for the forthcoming state assembly elections. BJP national general secretaries Tarun Chugh and Sunil Bansal will also attend the meeting, besides senior leaders such as BJP Telangana president Bandi Sanjay and MPs and former MPs.Sources said leaders from K Chandrashekar Rao's Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) are likely to join BJP later.The meeting is crucial as the saffron unit hopes to emerge as the prime opposition contender against the BRS in Telangana. Senior leaders are expected to hold a detailed seat-wise discussion on the state, sources said. A public contact programme and visits of senior leadership to the state ahead of the polls are also expected to be finalised today. Sources further said the names of BRS leaders propping up in the Delhi liquor case are likely to be discussed in today's meeting as well. The BJP is now playing its cards to emerge as a serious contender in the 119-member Telangana Assembly. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a third term in 2024, the BJP leadership will aggressively expand its footprints in Telangana. How the BJP values winning the Telangana assembly elections can be gauged from the fact that the party held its national executive in July last year in Hyderabad. The BJP has been eyeing expansion in South India ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, and securing a win in Telangana is an important aspect of its plan. With 17 Lok Sabha seats, Telangana is an important part of the party's southward expansion.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP was able to secure only four seats in Telangana. However, with an aggressive Hindu-Muslim pitch and attack on the dynastic legacy of the KCR-led BRS, the saffron party hopes to make a major gain in the region.Read all the Latest Politics News here","The meeting is crucial as the BJP hopes to emerge as the prime contender against the BRS in Telangana.

"The promotional advert for India's long-pending fifth Test against England is a weird one. For some reason, the ad agency and the broadcaster both decided to deem it a 'historic Test'. That is a fallacy, by definition.IND vs ENG 2022: World-class Indian Attack Capable of Putting England to The Pace TestIn sporting terms at least, you can only deem something historic once it has come to pass, and you can measure its significance in lasting terms, unlike the real-world scenario. For example, if you are Robert Oppenheimer and about to test detonate the first-ever atomic bomb, then, in that scenario you already know it is a historic moment. The differentiation, in the context of this Test series, is clear on its own.In simpler terms, if India wins this game, and takes the series 3-1, then yes, it will be deemed a historic Test. It will only be their 10th Test victory on English soil, and only the fourth-ever Test series win since 1971. Historic indeed, but again, not until the last ball has been bowled. Meanwhile, for England to draw this series 2-2, that won't have any historic significance whatsoever.Even so, it doesn't mean that this fifth Test doesn't hold any significance for Indian cricket. Beyond the aforementioned statistics, or the small matter of World Test Championship points, this Test comes as a fork in the road for Indian cricket. In particular, for this current bunch of senior players in the Indian team.Why? Well, India only has six other Tests remaining in this current FTP cycle. Two of those will be played away in Bangladesh (December, 2022) and four more at home against Australia (February-March, 2023). Unless India qualifies for the WTC Final (to be hosted in England) again, this fifth Test will mark the last proper overseas (SENA) challenge for a number of senior players in the current Indian set-up. And, who knows how this Indian Test team will look like in 2024?It is a journey that began back in 2014-15, when Virat Kohli assumed Test captaincy. What was a stand-in role at Adelaide, quickly transformed into a full-time capacity at the Sydney Test, and the change in India's approach towards the longer format was almost instantly visible. 16 out of 40 wins under Kohli's leadership came in overseas conditions. Winning on tours like West Indies and Sri Lanka became a walk-in-the-park.ENG v IND: Who Could Lead India in Rohit's Absence? Virat Would Have Been An Obvious ChoiceOf course, that wasn't enough, and armed with a lethal pace attack, India took the next step. Two series wins in Australia, winning Tests in South Africa and England, it became the norm. You expected India to win in overseas conditions, a far cry from the last decade. Go back further, and even with Sourav Ganguly's Golden Team, the expectation was to fight and maybe win, and not to just win.New Zealand is the one place that flummoxed this Indian team, and even the pacers couldn't work out the winning formula there. It brings back the aforementioned point - will Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Mohammed Shami and company get to revisit New Zealand and make amends? Perhaps not, and it brings further spotlight onto this impending fifth Test against England.Roll back four years, and sitting at the post-series press conference at The Oval in 2018, Kohli was in a belligerent mood. Both he and then coach Ravi Shastri were keen to profess how that 4-1 score-line didn't really tell the tale of their English tour. Truth told, it didn't - for all their bluster in many other press conferences, Kohli-Shastri were right to fight their cause. India had played well for most part of the series, and lost by the minimum margins at crucial junctures.The problem with score-lines though is they never tell an iota of the tale, leave alone a full one. Only those who were there will remember that 2018 series for what it was, and when Kohli-Shastri reached the English shores in 2021, they knew it well. To put it simply, India needed to win the Test series in England last year, and they almost did. 2-1 in four Tests - India put on a masterclass of pace bowling, of seizing moments when they mattered, and despite a few batting hiccups, they were poised to win the series in Manchester.Virat Kohli (left) will surely carry Indian batting hopes. (AFP Photo)And then, Covid-19 intervened. Should that fifth Test had gone ahead? It is a disputable topic, and one that has been put to rest. Yet, there is this desolate feeling about it all. Team India was so close to capping off a summit it had tried hard to scale four years prior. Winning in England, after two Test series wins in Australia, would have given Kohli-Shastri the ultimate prop-up in their last Test series together.None of it transpired, and just look how things have changed now. Shastri is not on the scene. Kohli is fighting a lonesome battle against his past glorious self, far away from the spotlight of captaincy. Rohit is in-charge, but fate has played a cruel hand and India's most impressive batter from last summer will miss this crucial fifth Test. Rahul Dravid is the coach now, but his team couldn't get past an ordinary South Africa in January. Jasprit Bumrah is the new (stand-in) Test captain in a must-not-lose game.To say, India is undercooked going into this fifth Test against Brendon McCullum's spirited England would be an understatement. Yet, it isn't far away from the truth. From the outside, it seems a disjointed patched-up squad. The batting is in transition with the likes of Hanuma Vihari and Shreyas Iyer looking to impress. And yet, with Rohit missing, India must rely on Cheteshwar Pujara once again. Kohli needs to be the star man and find his mettle against James Anderson - one last time.It is that key last phrase. Kohli marking his guard, as Anderson gets ready to bowl, four slips in place - a sight for the ages. Surely, it is the last bout for these two heavyweights. How will we remember it, by measures of runs and wickets, or wins and losses? How will Anderson remember it - that he helped England make it 2-2? How will Kohli remember it - will he be able to get across his arch nemesis and help India scale its most-wanted frontier? He may not be captain, but he is still very much the fulcrum of this Test side, more so in Rohit's absence.For Kohli and the likes of Rohit, Pujara, R Ashwin (who surprisingly didn't play a single Test last summer), Ravindra Jadeja, Shami and Umesh Yadav, this is the final step of a long, arduous overseas journey. One, which has seen many ups and downs, some disappointing moments (South Africa 2018 anyone?) and some glorious wonders (Gabba 2021 ahoy!).It is a journey they would want to finish on a winning note - a historic one.Get all the latest updates on Cricket News, Cricket Photos, Cricket Videos and Cricket Scores here","Unless India qualifies for the WTC Final again, this fifth Test will mark the last proper overseas (SENA) challenge for a number of senior players in the current Indian set-up",
"The Indian Railways is all set to send 52 station masters chosen from across its extensive network on an international work trip. This specialised training will help them gain exposure to the latest practices and measures in foreign countries. The Indian Railways Institute of Transport Management (IRITM) at Lucknow has been entrusted with this task of facilitating the advanced training module abroad. The stations chosen have either recently been upgraded or are being upgraded to offer world-class facilities and services.The training programme will last for two weeks and will include a comprehensive training module. Station masters below the age of 55 will be eligible, and applicants should not be due for any rotational transfer, possess a clean disciplinary and vigilance record and have a significant tenure. Each station will nominate two members, with one as its primary choice.'A directive focusing on the capability enhancement of station masters has been issued after extensive deliberation among board members. We have already upgraded many of our stations and are currently in the process of upgrading more. The foreign exposure will provide our station masters with valuable experience on how things work in other countries. Moreover, this firsthand experience will enable them to execute tasks with a diverse range of insights and practices in mind,' said a senior railway officer.The list of stations includes 11 from the Northern Railway, nine from Southern Railway, three from the South Western Railway among others from different zones.

"Guiding PhD candidates and having research work published in reputed journals may not be among the mandatory requirements for those applying for posts of director or principal in AICTE-affiliated institutes, according to changes recommended by an expert panel in the recruitment process.The panel was constituted by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) — regulator for technical education in the country — after it received representations from various faculty members requesting a revision of the existing qualifications for the posts.Existing norms, in place since 2019, state that to get shortlisted for the posts of director or principal, it is mandatory to have guided at least two successful Ph.D candidates as supervisor or co-supervisor, and have a minimum of eight research publications in government-approved academic journals.The committee also 'recommended widening the eligibility criteria and considering other alternatives, including founders or co-founders of start-ups or incubation units recognised by MSMEs or industry experts, with at least two utility patents, granted for the top post (director or principal)', the council said in a notification.It said the committee has suggested alternative eligibility criteria for the same, while 'keeping the above two as optional' — guiding Ph.D candidates and publishing of research work.The notification said the recommended criteria also includes candidates who have authored at least four books — text or reference — with reputed publishers and organised at least four conferences as convener. 'Those who have developed one MOOC course applicable at national platforms or having postgraduate certificate or diploma or degree in management/public administration,' the council said citing the recommendations on criteria for selection.The panel's recommendations have been put in public domain for 15 days to seek comments before the council includes them in a gazetted notification.",The panel was constituted by the AICTE — regulator for technical education in the country — after it received representations from various faculty members requesting a revision of the existing qualifications for the posts,The panel was constituted by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) — regulator for technical education in the country — after it received representations from various faculty members requesting a revision of the existing qualifications for the posts
"On the eve of our 74th Republic Day, President Droupadi Murmu rightly hailed 'the spirit of India' as well as our Constitution. The latter, she averred, had stood the test of time. Indeed, India's success as the world's largest democratic republic, in face of so many odds, adversities, and adversaries, is almost miraculous. It is the stuff that legends are made of. It is our differences which have united us, Murmu added. After all, unity and uniformity are two entirely different things. The former is essential to any great nation, but the latter is stifling. A monochromatic identity has never been the mark of Indian civilisation.Today, India is proud to be the fifth-largest economy in the world. But let us not forget that in 1950, when India became a republic after giving itself a Constitution, it was already the sixth-largest economy in the world. That too after independence and partition. In a sense, it has taken so long to catch up to where we once were. We have much more catching up to do because as recently as a couple of hundred years ago, we were the world's greatest economy. Similarly, India's development markers, whether in life expectancy, literacy, or in terms of freeing our masses from the curse of poverty, have all shown remarkable advancement. Without question, the most impressive strides have been made under the stewardship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.When the Republic Day parade rolls out in the renovated and revamped Central Vista, no Indian can help but feel justifiably proud. Raj Path has indeed turned into Kartavya Path. The parade itself is undoubtedly a colonial legacy. But it is still necessary to instil confidence that the Republic stands strong to protect the life and liberty of its citizens. Despite enemies on our borders, India has shown its resolve to protect its borders and its way of life.That brings me also to some causes for concern. Is it true that India, though an electoral democracy, is quite behind, as some foreign agencies put us, in the freedom index? For instance, if we look at the mass media today, we find that, to a large extent, it ends up parroting and promoting the government line, with anchors hectoring, sermonising, and lecturing audiences on what to think or believe. On matters of security and national integrity, such consonance is understandable, even desirable. But every discussion or debate cannot be turned into a cat-and-dog fight between supporters and opponents of the government.Social media, with its troll armies and sponsored bots, can be even more toxic and divisive. Managing the narrative seems so much more important than being truthful or reporting what is both factually and ethically accurate. There is behind this intolerance of dissent the mistaken, but assiduously peddled idea, that criticising the government is tantamount to anti-nationalism or anti-patriotism. Without a free and fair discussion, how will good ideas emerge? Unless the official narrative is challenged from time to time, how will a democratically elected government be held accountable?Does this mean that once a leader or party has won an election, they are not accountable to the public? Seeking feedback on government websites is not the same as public discussions and engagement with people on important policy matters. We saw what a huge debacle the farm laws were. One reason, surely, is the lack of proper consultations and confidence building among the stakeholders. The laws were, and still, are a crying need, if Indian agriculture is to be freed from the clutches of middlemen, rich farmers, and those who force the government to buy their crops whether we need them or not. But taking decisions without thorough discussions or consultations seems to be the order of the day.In addition, the continued use of colonial laws, including sedition, to target opponents of the regime, as also the possible misuse of central enforcement agencies, is a bad practice that does not behove a confident ruling party, let alone a great republic. Alas, such tendencies are visible not only in India, but in other major democracies.Centralising authority, weakening ministries, undermining anyone who dares to sing a tune different from the official one — all these are signs of the weakening of our swaraj. What will happen is that sycophancy will be rewarded, competence neglected, and power even more centralised. When you live in an echo chamber you will not hear the voices of the people. History has shown over and over again that the more power an individual leader accumulates, the more isolated and cut off from reality she is liable to be.I lived, as a young boy, through the dark days of the Emergency. Not only was the Constitution, including our fundamental rights, tampered with, if not suspended, but the press was muzzled too. I remember black -bordered blank pages published by major dailies to mark that dark day. The press, however, especially The Indian Express, led by the formidable Ram Nath Goenka, did not give in so easily. Most ordinary people, however, lived in daily dread of reprisals. Even those who had nothing to fear kowtowed to the regime and its agents. But Indira Gandhi lost badly when she, fortuitously for India, declared elections in 1977.No ruling regime can afford to be seen as more commanding than accommodating, more intolerant than inclusive. If vital lessons are to be learned from the past, the people of India are not dumb or foolish. They do not like leaders who are arrogant or who take them for granted. No single party or leader has a permanent claim, let alone monopoly, to their loyalty or affection. No matter how huge the personality cult is, inflated effigies are brought down into the dust in a matter of months.I am a great optimist as far as India is concerned. So, I believe, are most of the 1.4 billion of my fellow citizens. But let us remember that this country belongs to us — we the people of India. We are not ruled by princes, potentates, kings, emperors, viceroys, dictators, presidents-for-life, or general secretaries of single parties controlling an entire country. Our leaders, however great, are our elected representatives, not monarchs or sovereigns. They serve at our pleasure, not we at theirs.

"The Opposition, specially the Congress, is watching the developments in the NDA camp very closely as the BJP looks to find new alliances. The Congress, which hosts the Opposition meeting in Bengaluru next week, will ensure that its old friends and new potential allies remain together. There are two important developments to substantiate this.One, after the Parliament strategy meeting presided by Sonia Gandhi on July 15, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said, 'We will confront the government on many issues. One of them is their attempt to destroy the federal structure.' This is the closest the Congress has come to while taking a stand on whether it will support the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on the ordinance issue. According to sources, the topic was discussed at length at the meeting, but no clear stand was taken. While a few leaders felt that it was important to listen to the state units of Punjab and Delhi, who were against the idea of any support to AAP, others thought the 'Opposition Unity' was much bigger, therefore, it was alright to compromise for the sake of the fight to finish the BJP in 2024. Meanwhile, AAP sources told News18 that the party would want to see what the Congress has to say at the Bengaluru meet. AAP had raised the ordinance issue during the Patna meeting on June 23, and, in fact, did not attend the joint press conference in protest. The second development is that the relations between Trinamool Congress and Congress' are turning sour in the aftermath of the recently concluded West Bengal Panchayat Elections in which a few Congress workers were attacked in Murshidabad. State party president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury slammed chief minister Mamata Bannerjee, and told media that she is not 'invincible'. 'We will fight her and defeat her in Bengal.' But in a clear olive branch to the Congress, for the sake of Opposition Unity, a senior TMC leader told News18 that 'Panchayat polls is a thing of the past. Time to move on and fight the BJP together'. Sonia Gandhi had been the glue, which brought the dissenting parties together in 2004 to stitch a winning front called the UPA. As the BJP alliance outreach gathers steam, the Opposition is falling on Sonia Gandhi's magic to gear up for the 2024 battle.","The ordinance issue was discussed at length at the Parliament strategy meeting presided by Sonia Gandhi yesterday, but no clear stand was taken.

"The foundation for liberalization, privatization and globalization (LPG) was put in place 30 years ago in July 1991, and this brought in much-needed resilience and vibrancy in the Indian economy. It spurred not only the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) but also improved the ease of doing business as the cumbersome license culture was done away with. In hindsight, however, liberalization had caused a setback to industries in rural and backward areas of the country. Pre-liberalization, industries used to get a lot of incentives and concessions if these were located in rural and industrially deprived areas. These enabling measures were withdrawn in the wake of the economic reforms. As a result, industries were shifted from rural to urban areas, preferably in the vicinity of developed industrial cities, which adversely impacted the industrial growth in rural or backward regions of the country in the last 30 years.There was a time in the 1970s when leading players like JCT, Hawkins and Mahavir Spinning Mills had invested heavily in Hoshiarpur, the most backward area of Punjab, because of special incentives and concessions offered by the central and state governments. In states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where a chunk of low income group people live, there was a wide net of cottage industries, mostly engaged in textiles and handlooms. A large number of people were gainfully engaged. In due course of time, most of them got closed as they could not withstand the competition from bigger players, which forayed into rural markets with a bang. In the changed scenario, there are many incentives and concessions to develop industrial clusters and corridors but nothing for an industrialist if she desires to set up a unit in far flung areas.Era of New Normal The new normal, a significant outcome of COVID-19 pandemic, has reinforced the need to reorient our strategies for employment generation. Migration and reverse migration have left little scope for any doubt about the fact that India as an economy must generate gainful opportunities in rural areas at a large scale to accommodate local skilled and semi-skilled workforce, marginal farmers and farm labourers. Evenly distributed micro-level units, which can produce solopreneurs, and micro enterprises have to be created and supported in rural areas. For instance, processing and packaging of vegetables for sale in urban malls can be a micro-enterprise that may not need high capital investment but will be labour intensive at the block and subdivision levels in rural and backward areas.Too Little to Attract InvestmentIn view of the pandemic, the central government has introduced production linked incentive (PLI) schemes of Rs 1.97 lakh crore. It is unlikely that big or medium players will venture into rural and backward regions with investments without long-term sustainable incentives. The Union government has codified 29 central labour laws into four codes but none of these policies is sufficient to attract industrial investment in the hinterland. The idea of Atmanirbhar Bharat, which is so close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's heart, has to be aligned with the need to industrialize rural areas for which special incentives to investors must be extended. Without empowering rural economies and local communities, sustainable self-reliance will remain an ever-elusive proposition.Agriculture Has Its LimitationsNo doubt, Indian agriculture is the mainstay for the majority of rural populace but farming has its own limitations. It cannot ensure optimum utilization of human resources without supplementing agriculture with industrial opportunities. Even after 74 years of Independence, we have not been able to set food processing industries at sub-divisional and block level. Attracting investments in rural and backward areas through special incentives will give a boost to local economies and to the earnings of small farmers and farm labourers, who can earn Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000 per month easily by working for 8 hours in flexible shifts in nearby factories. It will also lessen the growing burden on agriculture. By generating jobs for rural population comprising marginal farmers and farm labourers through appropriate industrial pursuits in backward areas, it will be 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' given that 70 per cent of the country's population still resides in rural areas.Prolonged Lopsided Development a Bad OmenIt is not good for the nation to allow lopsided economic development. It has its own serious repercussions. If we fail to ensure holistic development, we will be accused of inefficiencies in handling human resources. Today there is a huge exodus of youth and others from Punjab, Haryana and other states to Canada, Australia and the Middle-East where they do all sorts of jobs to sustain themselves. Farming is no longer holding them back because they know well that they cannot be dependent on limited income from agriculture. Younger generations are too disenchanted to adopt farming. They have some opportunities in urban areas but they do not earn to save much. Earnings and expenses go side by side. If a village youth earns Rs 12,000 in a nearby factory, it will amount to earning not less than Rs 20,000 to Rs 22,000 in a city where he will have to spend a fair share of his earnings on food, lodging and travel.The Way ForwardThere is a pressing need to revisit our strategies at various levels—right from the ease of doing business at the district level to restructuring the credit and legal framework to recognize, create, and enable rural entrepreneurs. Our land usage laws are still structured around recognizing enterprises in industrial or commercial areas, and not in rural and backward areas. This needs to be changed. A micro-enterprise in a village or agricultural area should not be forced to go for land usage conversion. Rural entrepreneurs will create jobs in rural areas and need to be recognized by banks, non-bank financial institutions or NBFCs and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).Creating job opportunities in rural neighbourhoods for locals will not only check unnecessary migration but will also make rural life resilient as dreamt by Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi. The prevention of migration from rural to urban areas will remain a wishful thinking if job opportunities are not provided to small, marginal farmers and farm labourers in areas close to their native places. Time is running out for a positive policy and framework approach to promote industrial investments in rural and backward areas to create sustainable, gainful jobs for 70 per cent of the country's population.

"Karnataka assembly polls and the selection of the chief minister have been a great learning experience for the grand old party. Congress insiders say a 'Karnataka template' would be followed in the ensuing state polls of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, etc. At the same time, the Congress would attempt to fine-tune or reduce the mistakes it made between 14 and 18 May, 2023, when Siddaramaiah was chosen as the Karnataka chief minister amid hectic lobbying and a ring of secrecy.The real stars behind Siddaramaiah's crowning were Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge who emerged as a politician among politicians and Rahul Gandhi. Rahul helped Kharge tide over various pressures, lobbying and allurements from DK Shivakumar's camp. DK, as he popularly addressed in the party circles, was in no mood to give in, counting heavily on Sonia Gandhi. But a call in his favour did not come from 10, Janpath where Rahul now has a round-the-clock office-cum residence.Sonia's absence from Bangalore during the swearing-in and Rahul's spirited address at the occasion is a clear signal to Congress leaders, existing and potential allies that nothing would work without the consent and approval of Rahul who has full faith and trust in Kharge's judgement. In this sense, Kharge's emergence as 'Manmohan Singh' in the organisational and political affairs of the party is significant. Would it elevate to another level in May 2024 is a matter of sheer speculation.Away from the public glare, the power tussle in Karnataka is far from over and turning out to be a litmus test. The temptation of 'wet' portfolios is so brazen that not many are willing to adorn the high office of the Speaker. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah could not appoint 30 odd ministers amidst a bizarre demand that camp followers of various regional satraps would have a rotational tenure in office. The deadlock resulted in the party opting for nine ministers including a deputy chief minister. The names of the ministers who were sworn in on Saturday had to be vetted and cleared by Kharge.Incidentally, Kharge is said to have ordered an in-house probe into how a confidential communication approving eight ministers in the Siddaramaiah cabinet was leaked to the media. Apparently, Kharge is unhappy on two counts. Firstly, as a stickler for probity, is uncomfortable over the perception that he, instead of chief minister Siddaramaiah, had the final say in the selection of the Karnataka cabinet. BJP IT chief Amit Malviya was quick to comment, 'Consultation is one thing, but asking that the decision be implemented, undermines the authority of the Chief Minister's office.' On a more personal note, Kharge did not like being a father, recommending son Priyank's name. Priyank Kharge, a third-time MLA, deserved a ministerial berth on his own merit as he had served as IT minister in the previous Siddaramaiah government.The Congress leadership also reportedly wants to revisit its communication strategy between 14 and 18 May. The period saw near silence from AICC communication department and its office bearers namely Jairam Ramesh, Pawan Khera and Supriya Shrinate. There were continuous and inspired leaks on WhatsApp, 'unauthorised' spokespersons appearing on TV and a total absence of a quick response mechanism. While this period of disorder was dubbed as 'strategic,' clearly as an afterthought, party insiders say media management remains an area of concern. The Congress needs to figure out whether professional poll strategists working for individuals should be permitted to act as 'spokespersons' when their vested interest is in an individual or discouraged from public pronouncement, behind the scene lobbying etc.All eyes are on Kharge on two key issues. The Congress president was authorised to revamp the Congress Working Committee, AICC secretariat, constitute a central election committee, disciplinary committee and a number of other panels, departments and cells. The Gandhis have made it clear that they would not be publicly backing any contender for the party posts. Yet, Kharge, like Manmohan Singh of the 2004-14 era, has to cater to their likes, reward loyalties and present a somewhat youthful and professional face of the grand old party. His second challenge is resolving the ongoing logjam in Rajasthan. At an informal level, both CWC composition and the Rajasthan impasse need to be settled before 31 May when Rahul Gandhi travels abroad. Kharge and his team have a busy week ahead.The writer is a visiting fellow at the Observer Research Foundation.

"There is no easy way out of this war—for Russia, Ukraine or NATO. The war in Ukraine has thrown surprises at all three in the last 17 months. Russia did not see its 'special military operation' raging beyond a few weeks, Ukraine has been getting a bloody nose all through faltering Western support, and the West's Ukraine experiment — while being bloody and expensive — has no up-to-scratch gains to show for the quantum of weapons dispatched.In fact, what seemed like a bouquet of missiles, rocket launchers and tanks has morphed into a wreath on the graves of more than a conservative estimate of 150,000 Ukrainian soldiers, most of whom fought ill-equipped and without air cover. With the loss of these men, Ukraine lost some of its best and most-trained soldiers and has since been relying increasingly on a mix of young and old conscripts who are stepping into the battlefield with just a few weeks of training.While these facts have existed throughout the past year, Western media has taken a while to voice these realities bluntly. A Wall Street Journal report scathingly admits, 'Western military knew that Kyiv did not have enough training and weapons — from shells to combat aircraft — to dislodge Russian troops,' before it launched its counteroffensive. This is interesting because Ukraine was pressured to carry on anyway. WSJ states that the West hoped that 'Ukrainian courage and ingenuity would win.' That's a patronising way to describe the civilians that were turned into cannon fodder. The WSJ report goes on to say that they believed that 'Ukrainian courage and resourcefulness would carry the day,' but adds, 'they haven't. Deep and deadly minefields, extensive fortifications and Russian air power have combined to largely block significant advances by Ukrainian troops.'The West knew this would be the case all along. The 'fight till the last man standing' is a particularly convenient motto for the West when it does not have to deal with the caskets of the fallen.A New York Times report mentions how 'older, less motivated' recruits replacing young soldiers are lacking discipline and questioning the word of their commanders. 'Youth not only means better physical prowess, but younger soldiers are less likely to question orders,' says the report. As more men above the age of 40 enter the ranks, the problem of 'indiscipline' will only worsen for the Ukrainians who are fighting through a bloody stalemate.This is not to say that the Russian side is not taking heavy and needless losses, but it has a greater capacity to play the meat grinder tactic while stashing away a larger trained army to mount powerful offensive campaigns. It is also technologically superior despite Western assistance to Ukraine. When it comes to electronic warfare, the NYT reports that Russian abilities outmatch Ukraine's. This is clear from the impact of Russian Lancet drones on the Ukrainian psyche. Not only is the Russian drone powerful, but it is near-impossible to detect. Moreover, it says, 'Russian forces can detect cellphone signals and jam GPS and radio frequencies, and they are often looking for Starlink Wi-Fi routers to target with their artillery.'Meanwhile, Ukraine's spring counteroffensive which was delayed into the summer, has been flailing in the face of layers of Russian fortification at enemy lines. Dozens of Western Leopard 2 tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles were destroyed just days into the counteroffensive. Ukraine's air defences have not been bolstered by Western support as was hoped, especially of the Patriot systems. These are stationary and Ukraine has only two, one of which was reportedly damaged in May. And this is showing in Ukraine's continued vulnerability to air attacks. In a night of recent Russian attacks in Odesa on July 21, Ukraine could shoot down only five of 19 cruise missiles— a strikingly low success rate.The emerging stalemate at the frontlines has turned Ukraine to bigger and bolder attacks inside Russian territory and in Crimea. Attacks on the Kerch Bridge to Crimea and multiple drone attacks as far as Moscow serve as Volodymyr Zelenskyy's reminder to Vladimir Putin that Ukraine is still in the fight and will bring the war to Russia's doorstep rather than taking a step back.Ukraine has vowed to take all its territory back including Crimea which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Russia holds 20 percent of Ukrainian territory even as Ukraine reclaimed a few villages in its counteroffensive. Now there's a question of why Ukraine has not pierced through the enemy despite Western backing. This expectation is itself a product of misleading narratives in the run-up to justify billions of dollars of military aid to Ukraine. Western weaponry has been transferred in tranches and not all at once. This worked as long as Ukraine was fighting a defensive war which it got better at over time, but the counteroffensive has proved to be a different ball game. Going in with tanks and no air cover has been disastrous, especially as Russian soldiers planted landmines, dragon teeth and dug wide trenches to deter the assault. Ukraine has been demanding F-16 fighter aircraft to counter Russian air superiority, but the F-16s are not arriving anytime soon and training of Ukrainian pilots is beginning only in August. US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, says that it will take 'months and months'.The scramble for these fighter jets shows that the war is set to continue well into 2024. The West, and the US especially, have not given up on Ukraine despite apprehensions about the escalation with Russia, a poor Ukrainian counteroffensive, or the prospect of an ammunition crunch back home. The gains have been bumper— Sweden and Finland have joined NATO, Germany's romance with the Nord Stream Pipelines is over, American shipments of LNG are arriving at Europe's shores, most of Eastern Europe is firmly under the American spell, and the list goes on. But these are backhanded victories. Anything short of an ostensible Ukrainian victory is off-limits for the Biden Administration as the 2024 election year approaches. Ukraine needs to be a strategic and political victory for President Biden. It may somewhat politically redeem him after the botched-up withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. However, this victory is nearly impossible in the current circumstances. The second-best option then is a prolonged war that buys enough time until the November 2024 US elections.",The 'fight till the last man standing' is a particularly convenient motto for the West when it does not have to deal with the caskets of the fallen,

"On June 11, in a bold move, Pakistan's national assembly managed to pass a bill that would give the Indian national and ex-Naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav the right to appeal against charges of espionage. Kulbhushan Jadhav was awarded death sentence by a Pakistan military court in April 2017. In May the same year, India approached the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at the Hague, complaining that Pakistan had denied India consular access to Kulbhushan. The ICJ stayed the death sentence till the case was adjudicated.In July 2019, the ICJ delivered its verdict, demanding that Pakistan review the death sentence awarded to Kulbhushan. Forced by the ICJ verdict, Pakistan granted India consular access to Kulbhushan. It is in the light of the ICJ verdict, which states that Kulbhushan should be granted the right to appeal, that the Pakistan National Assembly passed the bill that would now allow the right of appeal to Kulbhushan.The question, however, is who will be reviewing the appeal when it is submitted? Given the hostile domestic environment in Pakistan towards India in general and Kulbhushan in particular, there is convincing evidence that the decision against the appeal will be influenced by forces that manipulate public opinion to exert pressure on the judicial system and the subsequent decisions taken by Pakistani courts. Hence, Pakistan must allow Indian lawyers access to Kulbhushan and prepare his appeal against the death sentence as well as his honourable repatriation to India.The court that should be set up to listen to the arguments of the defendant should comprise judges from a neutral country and the hearing should also take place in a neutral country. Meanwhile, in my opinion, Kulbhushan should be transferred to a prison in a neutral country too. His life is in danger in Pakistan since the negative hype created by the media and right-wing clergy in Pakistan has already affected the psyche of the majority of Pakistani population—that Kulbhushan is guilty of involvement in anti-Pakistani state activities.No substantial proof of Kulbhushan's involvement in espionage activities has thus far convincingly been established. All we know is that he was an Indian businessman trading in Iran who was allegedly kidnapped and brought to Pakistan.To ensure that Kulbhushan gets a fair hearing during the appeal, he must be transferred to a prison in a neutral country where a neutral panel of judges should hear the arguments presented against the accusations made by the Pakistani military. Currently, Kulbhushan remains in the custody of the Pakistan military.Dr Amjad Ayub Mirza is an author and a human rights activist from Mirpur in PoJK. He currently lives in exile in the UK.

That could help Apple price the iPhone 12 phones more aggressively, something we saw with the iPhone XR and the iPhone 11 once the manufacturing in India started.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here","Apple has announced that starting Thursday, January 21, there will be a cashback scheme that will be applicable for all orders that have the final checkout amount of Rs 44,900 or more on the Apple India Online Store.

"Topmost institutes as well as various countries have hailed India's National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 as the world's 'biggest reform' and shown interest in implementing it, said Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' on Saturday. The minister, who was addressing the 97th annual convocation of Delhi University, said the new education policy that has been brought into place after 'much deliberation' will see India 'reform, perform and transform'.He also praised the policy calling it 'impactful, interactive, innovative and inclusive' built on the cornerstone of 'equity, quality and access'. 'Cambridge, the UAE, Australia, Mauritius, Indonesia, .. and many others have said India's NEP is the world's biggest reform and that they want to implement in their countries as well. It is both national and international, supports 'vocal for local' and also local for global. This will bring a new set of opportunities for students,' said Nishank, encouraging Delhi University to be the 'flag-bearer' of the policy and implement it in 'mission-mode'.The NEP, approved by the Union Cabinet, replaces the 34-year-old National Policy on Education framed in 1986. It is aimed at paving the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems to make India a global knowledge superpower. The 61-year-old leader here also counted on the various achievements of India's education system during the pandemic year. Like how it worked tirelessly in implementing 'digital education', transformed homes into schools and didn't let the year go waste for India's 33 crore students — more than the total population of the USA. To give an idea of how herculean the task was, the minister even shared the data on the size of Indian education system: '1,000 universities', '50,000 degree colleges', '15 lakh schools' and '1.10 crore teachers'.'We conducted the exams on time, the results were out on time, and also JEE or NEET — world's biggest examination in the corona era — were conducted successfully. Also, we provided online education to 33 crore students. This was huge, something that you don't even think of in your dreams, but we did it and did it successfully,' he noted.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here","Ramesh Pokhriyal said the new education policy that has been brought into place after 'much deliberation' will see India 'reform, perform and transform'.","The minister, who was addressing the 97th annual convocation of Delhi University, said the new education policy that has been brought into place after 'much deliberation' will see India 'reform, perform and transform'"

"Kolkata: National badminton coach Pullela Gopichand said on Tuesday he is happy if the rivalry between women singles stars P.V. Sindhu and Saina Nehwal helps them become better players. Sindhu, thanks to two World Championships bronze medals and the 2016 Olympic silver medal, has forced Saina to share the Indian badminton limelight lately. The rivalry has also moved off court. While Saina signed an annual deal of Rs 40 crore with a private firm after her bronze medal at the 2012 London Games, Sindhu reportedly has signed an annual deal of Rs.50 crore -- making her the highest-earning sportsperson apart from the cricketers. While Saina is a trailblazer, Sindhu, according to some sports experts, has gone beyond the former in terms of major medals accumulation. Saina also has a World Championship silver medal in her successful career. ""If it helps their performance get better I am happy,"" Gopichand, who is the mentor of Sindhu who who won a silver for India in the 2016 Rio Olympics, told reporters on the sidelines of Boria Majumdar's book launch 'A History of Indian Sport through 100 Artefacts' here. Sindhu and Saina have been fiercest rivals over the years and on Monday teamed up for a doubles match for employers Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited at the 38th PSPB inter-unit badminton championship in Bangalore. The star pair went down fighting against doubles specialist pair of N Sikki Reddy and Aparna Balan. Sikki Reddy and Aparna Balan beat Sindhu-Saina duo 19-21, 21-18, 20-22. Asked about Sindhu's next target, Gopichand said the World Championships, starting August 21, and the All England Open Badminton Championships will always be the top priority. ""We have the World Championships coming up. That will be a good tournament to win. Overall, we will have an Olympic medal activity. Every year, the World Championships and the All England will be the two most prized positions along with the other Super Series events,"" he said. On Saina's lean patch, Gopichand who coached the former junior champion previously, said he is certain the former World No. 1 will be at her best soon. ""Saina has had some good performances and I hope she comes back strongly,"" he said. Besides Nehwal and Sindhu, Gopichand tipped West Bengal's Rituparna Das to come good in the coming years. ""Rituparna Das is in the top fifty. It's a good position to be behind Saina and Sindhu. She is the next highest ranked players in the country. There is still time when she can reach the top ten in the world. I am sure she is somebody who is working hard and will have success in the future,"" he said. Gopichand hoped Tokyo 2020 will be better than Rio. ""There is still time. It's been a tough journey till now and it will get more tougher because the benchmarks have gone higher. I hope that we will be able to achieve better results next time than what we did last time,"" he said. On a different note, the former All England Open Badminton Championships winner in 2001, said it is important for all stakeholders in sport to stay on the same page. ""For sport to come up, it should be system supporting, coach led and athlete centric. For any sport to come up, it is always people first, programmes next, infrastructure and facilities come third,"" he said. ""The other being it has to be coach driven. We are very administrative driven at many places. Sometimes when players become successful, it becomes successful athlete led, successful athlete centric programmes which are disasters. we need a mature system to understand sport. we need to integrate all our systems together to make sure sport goes to the next level. we are a little far away from that. We need to agree on sport, on a common philosophy. We are here and there. There are corporates working, schools working, federations working, NGOs working, government working but all independently,"" the 43-year old signed off.",National badminton coach Pullela Gopichand said on Tuesday he is happy if the rivalry between women singles stars P.V.
