# PEGASUS News Summarization

A full pipeline for abstractive news summarization using the PEGASUS transformer, including data preprocessing, tokenization, model training, evaluation, and a Streamlit-powered web interface.

---

## Project Overview

This project fine-tunes the `google/pegasus-xsum` model on English news articles.  
It covers robust cleaning, tokenization, efficient sequence-to-sequence training, performance evaluation with ROUGE metrics, and a ready-to-use web demo app for generating summaries.
